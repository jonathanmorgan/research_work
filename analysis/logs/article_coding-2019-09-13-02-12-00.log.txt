2019-09-13 02:15:39,843 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By leonard N. Fleming The Detroit News Detroit — Mayor Dave Bing is lobbying the Obama administration for $500 million to $1 billion to bolster job growth, eradicate blight and address illiteracy and poverty. The mayor, who was elected in May and won a four-year term in November, has been to the White House three times in recent months and has met with Cabinet secretaries of treasury, transportation, housing and urban development, commerce and labor. "This city will not survive without federal support in a big way," Bing told The Detroit News in a recent interview. "Our range is somewhere between a half a billion and a billion dollars. I'm prepared to ask for what we're going to need." Bing has not met with the president yet and no meeting is scheduled but he realizes he's "got to be patient. "We've had eye contact and he knows me," the mayor said. Given the struggling auto industry, foreclosure and unemployment rate of about 30 percent, "we are the city that's probably been hurt the most in the downturn in the economy both from a housing standpoint and also from an industry standpoint," Bing said. Bing wants a mix of old and new money as well as federal stimulus money. Bing came into office saying he wants to compete for more grants and said most of the money he's seeking is independent of stimulus funds. To date, the city has applied for nearly $300 million in grants, been awarded about $187 million but only received 10 to 12 percent of that money, city officials said. In the next few weeks, city officials are expected to request another $300 million for projects ranging from cops and transit to building demolitions. City officials couldn't say how much Detroit typically receives in federal funds, citing poor records from past administrations William Rustem, president and CEO of Lansing-based Public Sector Consultants, said the mayor is "right in asking for the money" but shouldn't expect to get all that they want even though "Detroit is the poster children for Michigan" and its problems. "Detroit can't do it all by itself," Rustem said. "There aren't enough people in Detroit to make it happen, there are not enough resources to make it happen." Bing is also seeking greater flexibility in receiving the federal money because many of the grants, city officials say, are funded to cities through reimbursement and Detroit facing a $300 million deficit cannot put cash up. The mayor's efforts follow calls from Councilwoman JoAnn Watson and others for a "Detroit Marshall Plan." The councilwoman has called for a bailout of $1 billion to $10 billion for the city. Bing has been increasingly vocal about the need for federal help in public appearances. On Thursday, he told a community forum that "it's going to be difficult for us to come back without some massive federal support." Councilman Andre Spivey, who was elected in November, said that if Bing is able to get the funds he's seeking, it "would be great but that money won't last forever." Spivey said the Bing administration needs to look at finding additional revenue streams and "we need to get people back in the neighborhoods for property taxes." lfleming@detnews.com (313) 222-2072

2019-09-13 02:15:45,461 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Shawn D. Lewis The Detroit News Southfield — Police removed more than two dozen cats — including a dead one — Friday morning from a home on Civic Center Drive after neighbors complained about a foul odor. Lt. Nick Loussia with Southfield Police said the cats were taken away for their safety. "Initially, the homeowner was cooperating with police, and then that ceased and a search warrant was obtained," Loussia said. "But there's been no arrest, and it's too soon to determine if charges will be made." The homeowner could not be contacted Friday for comment. Her ex-husband said he was unaware of the situation; the two owned a dog while they were married. "I have no idea what's going on with the cats because I haven't been in touch with her for over 30 years," he said. Some cats escaped the officers, who had a search warrant to remove 30 cats. On Friday afternoon, a gray cat peered from the front window of the beige vinyl-sided home, while a black cat slid beneath a huge gap under a garage door. Loussia said the cats appeared to be well-fed and had water. An empty Tidy Cats box sat in the back of the house Friday near several garbage bags, along with a cat carrier. Loussia said he did not know where the cats were taken. Numerous calls to Southfield Animal Control were not returned. In another animal hoarding situation, Kenneth Lang, formerly of Dearborn, has been ordered to pay more than $61,000 for housing 105 dogs and more than 150 dead ones in freezers last summer. Wayne County Circuit Judge Timothy Kenny also sentenced Lang to five years probation. slewis@detnews.com (734) 462-2190

2019-09-13 02:15:47,470 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Jaclyn Trop The Detroit News Transplanted Detroiters, rejoice: Coney Island is coming to the Windy City. Leo's Coney Island will be the first of the many incarnations of Metro Detroit's coney islands to export the chili-, onion- and mustard-topped hot dog outside the state when it opens a franchise in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood Monday. "Native Detroiters are literally ready to rip our door off the hinges," said Lou Goldhaber, co-owner of the Chicago Leo's Coney Island. "It's a total built-in customer base." Named for the Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood that birthed the hot dog, coney islands have been a Motor City fixture over the last century. Mostly Greek-owned, the concept offers coney dogs and Mediterranean fare, such as Greek salad and gyros, as well as typical diner fare including hamburgers, fries, omelets and dessert. While there is debate about which was Michigan's first coney island — American and Lafayette Coney Islands in Detroit and Todoroff's Original Coney Island in Jackson all stake claim — the first opened during World War I. Both the hot dog and restaurant format have become quintessentially Michigan and slow to spread across state lines. Until now. Leo's Coney Island, a 41-location franchise that began in Southfield in 1972, has been exploring opportunities in Chicago and other places where Michiganians have migrated, including Florida and Arizona, said Leo Stassinopoulos Jr., director of franchising and son of the restaurant's eponymous co-owner. In Chicago, "the name recognition is there for sure," Stassinopoulos said. Excitement on the blogosphere has been mounting, with a countdown until the Chicago location opens its doors. "If you're not from Michigan, it might be time you see the proper way to serve a hot dog," one blogger wrote. Dana Kaplan, a West Bloomfield Township native living in Chicago, said she and her hometown friends plan to visit Leo's as soon as it opens. "Living in Chicago, we don't get Leo's very often," she said. "I've been eating their Greek salad since I was 10. It's nice to have something from home here." Leo's is not the only coney island to expand beyond Metro Detroit's borders. Roseville-based National Coney Island opened a quick-service East Lansing store in September to cater to the Michigan State University crowds. The store, which has 25 menu items, or about half the offerings of a traditional National Coney restaurant, has been so popular that the company is thinking of extending its weekend hours (now 11 a.m. to 3 a.m., Thursday through Saturday) and offering breakfast and home delivery, said Bradford Egan, director of business development. "We have a very loyal following; it's almost cult-like," he said. National Coney Island is also developing a larger, aggressive expansion plan it will reveal in the spring, Egan said. The restaurant is looking at opportunities within Michigan as well as outside. Detroit's coney restaurants are optimistic that other cities, such as Chicago, which is already famed for its own hot dog style — with mustard, onion, dill pickle, tomatoes and sweet pickle relish — will embrace the Michigan dog. The restaurants strike a balance between traditional diners and burger joints, Egan said, and have the added benefit of bringing a novelty — a hot dog ensconced in chili and mustard — to new frontiers. "It would just be a matter of getting people to try the restaurant," Egan said. "Once they experience it, they'll want to come back." The coney concept will resonate with new consumers as long as it remains convenient, inexpensive and tasty, said Harry Balzer, a Chicago-based vice president at NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. The average price point at both Leo's and National Coney Island is less than $8. "What eaters love is new versions of things they already know," Balzer said. "Trying is not going to be the issue." But Chicago's hot dog merchants say it's a tough market to penetrate, as a failed attempt by Brooklyn-based Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs has shown, said Patty Sullivan, spokeswoman for Portillo's Restaurant Group, which includes Chicago hot dog behemoth Portillo's. The chain has 32 locations in the city and two in Southern California, where many Chicago transplants live. "Chicago is a very tough market," Sullivan said, "but time will tell."

2019-09-13 02:15:49,469 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- A tour of secondary schools is planned this morning for the Godwin Heights Board of Education to get a feel for potential campus reconfigurations. Four concepts are being considered to cut costs in line with continued reductions in state funding, board President Allen E. Johnston said. He did not disclose specifics, but confirmed a school might be closed. "In order for us to meet budget, we're going to have to make cuts. We're going to have to change some things," Johnston said. "Nothing's really cast in stone. It's all kind of laying things out, 'Here's one, here's two, here's three, here's four,' and from those we're going to have to come to a consensus. "The bottom line is, if there is no money, you can't continue to tax people. You have to cut programs. You've got to cut some jobs. It's just being fiscally responsible." The 9 a.m. meeting is scheduled to start at the district's administration building, 15 36th St. SW. Johnston said he expects the board to spend about 90 minutes touring the neighboring middle school and high school. A recommendation on any facility changes could come to the board March 1, Superintendent Jon Felske said. "I will bring to them at least four, if not five, models," he said. Felske said one plan would keep the existing configuration while others would involve closing a building. Today's tour will give elected leaders a look at how programs might be moved into the middle school and high school. "I don't know if they know how much open space is in those two buildings," Felske said. "Our three elementary buildings have very decent enrollment. The empty space in the district comes from those two (secondary) buildings." The idea of moving grade levels into different buildings sparked criticism this week from school board candidate Kenneth Hornecker, who is on May's ballot along with incumbents Lee Ann Platschorre and Roderick VanOeveren. He called for more service consolidation with neighboring districts instead. "While it might make economic sense, you can start to overcrowd buildings," Hornecker said. "I think we can utilize Wyoming resources to a greater degree than we are. I don't know that we can't eliminate more of our administrative staff and tap Wyoming, and possibly pick up a third district." Wyoming and Godwin Heights share a superintendent, finance director and some other services. Both districts, as well as neighboring Godfrey Lee and Kelloggsville, spend less on administration than most area schools, according to the state Senate Fiscal Agency. No further consolidation is being considered at this point, Felske said.

2019-09-13 02:15:51,472 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By David Shepardson The Detroit News Washington — Automakers spending on lobbying fell in 2009 for the second straight year, to $60.2 million — down from a record $70.3 million spent in 2007. Last year, auto industry lobbying was $65.5 million, according to the nonpartisan Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. It comes as spending for lobbying keeps rising. Governments and other interests spent a record $2.8 billion to lobby Washington in 2007; that figure climbed to $3.5 billion in 2009 — a new record. Before the last two years, auto lobbying expenses climbed at a fast rate — up nearly 20 percent in 2007 to battle higher fuel efficiency regulations and other issues in Congress. But automakers slashed expenses as the industry had a dreadful 2009. General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC, which survived because of $65 billion in government bailouts, scaled back lobbying activities last year. Both companies voluntarily stopped making campaign donations from their political action committees. The two automakers have hired new lobbyists. GM brought in two lobbyists with ties to AT&T and GM's new CEO Edward Whitacre Jr. Chrysler announced last month that Robert Liberatore, a retired Chrysler lobbyist, was returning on an interim basis to advise CEO Sergio Nardelli. The company's lobbyist, John Bozzella, left to work for Chrysler's former parent company, Cerberus Capital Management LP. Last year, GM canceled its lobbying contracts with about dozen outside firms, but has since hired a few back — including one with tax expertise. Lobbying expenses by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers — the trade association representing Detroit's Big Three automakers, Toyota and seven others — fell from $7.3 million in 2008 to $5.8 million in 2009 Lobbying expenses • GM: $8.5 million in 2009, down from $13.1 million in 2008 • Chrysler: $3.5 million in 2009, down from $4.8 million in 2008 • Ford Motor Co.: $7 million in 2009, down from $7.7 million in 2008 • Toyota Motor Co.: $5.3 million — about the same as in 2008 dshepardson@detnews.com (202) 662-8735

2019-09-13 02:15:53,473 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- Speaking to the Downtown Rotary Club on Thursday, Mayor George Heartwell shortened his "State of the City" speech by more than two-thirds from the original version delivered about two weeks ago. But Heartwell intensified his push for a unified regional government before the business group, whose members are just as likely to live in the suburbs as the city. "I'm talking about governmental consolidation," he said. "I'm talking about one city in the place of the many units of government that make up our region." Suburbs, such as East Grand Rapids or Kentwood, still could exist in name while being governed under an umbrella that consolidates services, Heartwell said. "A unified government could still maintain the special identity of each unit," said Heartwell, who received polite applause for his message. While planners point to successful unified governments elsewhere, Heartwell reminded his audience there already are about 150 joint ventures at work among West Michigan communities. "This is where you come in," he said. "I believe the most powerful tool to overcome the political and cultural barriers is the business community." East Grand Rapids resident Bob Dean said he liked Heartwell's message. "It's a challenging vision, and I'd like to see progress on it," said Dean, director of the Grand Rapids Children's Museum. "I think a lot of my neighbors realize the long-term value to it also." Cascade Township resident Tom Swets said Heartwell's pitch for consolidation "seems very sensible." Whether his neighbors would support consolidation remains to be seen, said Swets, a retired banker. "I'd be happy to be part of a consolidation effort," he said. Matt Zimmerman, a resident of the city's Southeast Side who works for a Cascade Township construction firm, said consolidation was a good idea, but he questioned how it would be received in suburban communities.

2019-09-13 02:15:55,474 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRANDVILLE -- Hobby Lobby will relocate its Jenison store Monday to roomier digs almost three miles away in Grandville. The arts and craft store will move into 4535 Canal Ave. SW, the former storefront of a Circuit City that closed in early 2009 after the electronics retailer filed bankruptcy. Hobby Lobby has been at its current location, 7500 Cottonwood Drive in Georgetown Township, for the past decade. In addition to more space, the new location will put the retailer in a higher-traffic area, said John Schumacher, assistant vice president for advertising. "We enlarge a significant number of stores each year through expansions or relocations," he said. The move will increase the sales floor space to more than 56,000 square foot. Staffing will continue at about 50 to 55 employees. The new location puts the store about a mile from the region's biggest mall, RiverTown Crossings -- and just over a mile from competitor Michael's Arts & Crafts, 4830 Wilson Ave SW. Hobby Lobby's hours will remain the same: 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays.

2019-09-13 02:15:57,482 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - LANSING -- Gov. Jennifer Gran-holm today endorsed taxing the sale of most personal services, reducing the sales tax rate from 6 percent to 5.5 percent and using the proceeds to cut business taxes and bolster funding for K-12 schools. The tax overhaul provides the foundation of the fiscal 2011 budget plan that Granholm presented to lawmakers in the Capitol this morning. The blueprint closes an estimated $1.6 billion gap in revenues and expenditures. Administration officials kept details of the plan under wraps Wednesday, but the budget presumes nearly $330 million in savings by offering 46,000 eligible state employees and school personnel incentives to retire by Sept. 30. Another assumption is $500 million-plus in additional federal aid for the state's Medicaid health care system. Granholm's budget also funds a revamped Michigan Promise scholarship eliminated in the 2010 budget. Michigan's sales tax applies to most goods, except groceries and prescription drugs. It taxes few services. Granholm's proposal mirrors a plan drafted by the CEO group Business Leaders for Michigan. It greatly broadens that sales tax base to include an array of services that are a growing share of the economy. Additional revenue from the tax would finance a phaseout of the $600 million, 2007 surcharge to the Michigan Business Tax and provide an immediate $500 million for the state school aid fund. The base would continue to exclude business-purchased services, health care and education such as college tuition. It presumably would include services such as entertainment, car repair and dry cleaning, and could include accounting, legal and insurance. Rep. Mark Meadows, D-East Lansing, has a bill to expand the base and reduce the sales tax rate to 5 percent. The key for Granholm and supporters of the idea will be to identify what services will be taxed and then protect the list from an expected lobbying onslaught from interests seeking carve-outs. A 2007 sales tax expansion collapsed and was replaced by the MBT surcharge because it was riddled with loopholes. Ski tickets were taxed; golfing fees were not. "As this gets more serious, we're going to have more people coming in and saying it shouldn't include us," Meadows said. "It's better to have everybody in (the base) so no one feels jealous about who gets out." Another flashpoint will be Republican resistance to a tax plan that generates new revenue for government services and education. Any tax overhaul, said Sen. Mark Jansen, R-Gaines Township, also has to come after passage of reforms, such as his proposal to make every public employee in the state contribute at least 20 percent toward of the cost of health insurance. The Business Leader's plan is revenue neutral overall in that every dime of additional sales tax revenue pays for eliminating the MBT surcharge and cutting a key MBT rate on business revenue. But the business community is split over the idea. Michael Johnston, head of legislative affairs for the Michigan Manufacturers Association, said every business in the state would benefit from Business Leaders for Michigan's plan. "We compete on the basis of cost with the lowest cost location in the world," he said. "Our tax policy, if it's going to be successful in creating jobs, has to understand that dynamic." Richard Studley, president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said business tax reduction should be paid for through meaningful reductions in the size of state government, not "overly complicated, meaningless tax shifts. The problem isn't the method of taxation. It's that we're losing taxpayers." Granholm, with just months remaining in office, will have to persuade the public that higher sales taxes but lower business taxes will lead to job creation. Fellow Democrats in the Legislature are going to oppose a revenue neutral approach that requires them to raise taxes and then approve another round of unpopular budget cuts to local K-12 districts. School funding was sliced $165 per pupil in 2010. Based on current revenue estimates, the state's school aid fund for K-12 is short $422 million, or $267 per pupil. The state's main checkbook for general state services is nearly $1.2 billion out of whack, even after nearly $1 billion in budget cuts in fiscal 2010. "We've cut so far already, it's hard to imagine where they'd get more without eliminating whole programs," said Sharon Parks, director of the Michigan League for Human Services. If Granholm's support for a tax overhaul is to lead to an actual bill signing some time this spring or summer, a deal will have to be cut somehow. There is plenty of skepticism that a Capitol enveloped by partisanship and election-year concerns is capable of pulling it all off. "Everyone's standing on one side of the river or the other staring at each other and the clock's running," said Charles Owens, director of the National Federation of Independent Business-Michigan. But Owens added that many of his members who pay the MBT would see a significant tax cut. And Lynn Jondahl, spokesman for a coalition of budget recipients, A Better Michigan Future, said expanding the sales tax base helps fix the budget and makes the tax more progressive. All taxpayers pay sales tax on clothes. Lower-income taxpayers don't often get them dry cleaned. "It could be a relatively progressive shift," he said. E-mail: pluke@boothnewspapers.com.

2019-09-13 02:15:59,483 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By David Shepardson and Alisa Priddle The Detroit News Four governors from states with Toyota Motor Corp. plants spoke out Wednesday in defense of the Japanese automaker and questioned the U.S. government's conflict of interest as a stakeholder in some of Toyota's rivals. In a rare show of support for the embattled Toyota, the governors wrote to congressional representatives who will lead hearings about Toyota's recalls and how it handled customer complaints. "Despite the federal government's obvious conflict of interest because of its huge financial stake in some of Toyota's competitors, it has spoken out against Toyota including statements U.S. government officials have later been forced to retract," the letter said, a reference to comments last week by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The letter was signed by governors Steve Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat; and Republicans Mitch Daniels of Indiana; Haley Barbour of Mississippi; and Bob Riley of Alabama. "It is unfortunate and unfair that Toyota has fallen victim to aggressive and questionable news coverage of these issues when the real story is how quickly Toyota identified the problems, found solutions and delivered those solutions to its dealers worldwide," the governors wrote. The letter emerged as the pressure on Toyota continued unabated from Chicago, where the automaker was a center of attention at the Chicago Auto Show, to Washington, where a congressional hearing on Toyota's recalls scheduled for Wednesday was postponed after a fresh snowstorm struck the capital. Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Toyota President Akio Toyoda should come before the committee and testify this month. "Given the number of outstanding questions surrounding Toyota's relationship with U.S. regulators and in the best interests of moving forward, I'd like to help facilitate a dialogue between Mr. Toyoda and lawmakers from both parties and both chambers," said Issa, one of the lawmakers addressed by the governors. Toyoda, the grandson of the automaker's founder, told reporters in Japan that he would come to the United States to meet with company staffers and dealers, among others, but did not say when. Company officials say he is unlikely to come before March. Congressional hearings will start in late February. At the Chicago Auto Show media preview Wednesday, Toyota's troubles were front and center. Toyota officials came to Chicago hoping to use the show to reassure a nervous public about the safety of its vehicles, both present and future. But the company's most important presentation, the unveiling of the new Toyota Avalon sedan, was overshadowed by the enormous media interest in the automaker's difficulties over the recent recalls. Toyota has recalled more than 8 million vehicles since September, mostly to fix problems that could lead to unintended acceleration. The new Avalon was largely ignored as a crush of reporters pressed executives for updates about Toyota's recalls. Other manufacturers also struggled to get their message out. Even executives from rival companies were being asked about the likely impact of Toyota's troubles. Bob Carter, head of Toyota brand sales in the U.S., said that the automaker is fixing vehicles at a furious rate while preparing to launch the Avalon, the largest sedan in the Toyota lineup in North America. It will go on sale this spring with "a wide array of safety features," he said. The unveiling of the Avalon shows life goes on at Toyota, said Howard Polirer, director of industry relations for AutoTrader.com. He said that if plans to show the Avalon had been dropped, it would have generated speculation that future products from the automaker were also in jeopardy. As for current customers, dealerships have repaired more than 220,000 vehicles with gas pedal problems and continue to do so at a rate of about 52,000 a day, Carter said. He reiterated that Toyota doesn't believe electronic throttle issues are involved. Dealers on Tuesday received the software fix they need to address braking issues with the Prius and Lexus HS hybrids. Letters to Prius customers will go out by week's end and Lexus owners will get their letters within weeks, Carter said. But anyone who comes into a dealer now will be taken care of. Because the congressional hearing on the recalls was postponed, the auto show became the public forum for Toyota to address its woes, said Ed Kim, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific in Tustin, Calif. Given the criticism the automaker has come under for not being transparent enough or quick to action, "they had to say something," Kim said. Other automakers at the show were careful not to appear opportunistic as the world's No.1 automaker continues to falter. Mark Reuss, president of GM North America said to do so would be tacky. Jim Farley, Ford Motor Co.'s head of global marketing, did not want to speak ill of Toyota, his former employer. But he said Ford was seeing more Toyota trade-ins, and uncertainty about the resale value of Toyota vehicles has boosted prices in the used car market in the last 30 days. "That's what happens when you take 20 percent of vehicles out of the used-car market." Honda Motor Co. has not seen an influx in sales from Toyota customers, said spokesman Kurt Antonius. Honda is "not taking advantage of the situation," he said. "We have our own vehicles to sell and they are a tough competitor and we will continue to compete with them. "Everyone's had recalls," Antonius said. "It's not a new phenomenon in our business." Meanwhile, legal threats against Toyota continued to mount. Lawyers with nearly two dozen firms around the country hope to consolidate their claims that Toyota's recalls have cost customers billions of dollars. P. Tim Howard, a Northeastern University law professor leading the group seeking class-action status for lawsuits, said Wednesday that the more than 8 million vehicles recalled by Toyota have collectively lost more than $2 billion in resale value because of the recalls. Toyota's Carter dismissed suggestions that quality had slipped as a result of the company's growth to become the world's largest automaker. "Nothing is more important to Toyota than restoring the trust and confidence of our customers," Carter said. Toyota update Ruling bars documents from being released Toyota Motor Corp. won a temporary ruling barring Dimitrios Biller, a former in-house lawyer who accuses the carmaker of hiding evidence in rollover-accident lawsuits, from going public with confidential documents, said Jeffrey Allen, a lawyer for Biller. A former judge arbitrating the case rejected Toyota's request to require Biller to turn over the documents or to provide an inventory of them, Allen said. Biller sued Toyota in July, claiming the company destroyed engineering and testing evidence relevant in more than 300 lawsuits over sport-utility rollover accidents. Biller, who worked for Toyota from 2003-07, was sued first by Toyota in California state court after he started a legal consulting business. Bloomberg News Caption: Automaker under fire

2019-09-13 02:16:01,485 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Louis Aguilar The Detroit News Some five years ago, Skilled Manufacturing Inc., a supplier of powertrain components for the auto industry, shuttered one of its two plants in the Traverse City area, laying off 200 workers, after one of the company's automotive clients moved the work to Mexico. The factory is reopening this year to supply powertrain parts to the aerospace industry, which will bring back 75 jobs initially. "I've spent 35 weeks a year, every year, traveling to make that transition happen," said W. Dodd Russell, president of Skilled Manufacturing. "There is nothing sexy about the transition, and there's no magic formula. I just get on a plane and go to conferences and meetings and get out there and sell. "It really is just a matter of survival." The auto supply industry's wrenching restructuring may be settling down as many suppliers look beyond the auto industry for work, and others find a way to hang on despite the biggest decline in U.S. auto sales in decades. As of October, 112,000 Michiganians worked in vehicle and parts supply manufacturing, down from 320,000 at the start of the decade, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor. The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association estimates that at least 50 suppliers filed for bankruptcy and 200 liquidated last year nationwide. Many companies, like Skilled Manufacturing, survived by becoming suppliers to other sectors. A good portion of suppliers — from tier one companies that supply automakers directly, to the smaller tiers — are looking for ways to diversify, said Kim Hill, an analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. Hill said the sector took a major hit from the dramatic decline in U.S. car and truck sales in the last two years and the subsequent 2009 bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler. "Until last year, most suppliers were pretty busy keeping up with the business that was still out there," Hill said. "Many were doing just fine. "But if an auto assembly plant goes down to 50 percent utilization, that often means a parts supplier can go down to 70 percent utilization." Help comes from the states Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Ohio often offer significant tax breaks and other incentives to help auto suppliers diversify. Skilled Manufacturing, for example, received a Michigan tax credit worth $571,000 to encourage the company's diversification. The state also awarded a $154,000 tax credit to SoundTech Inc, a Kentwood-based supplier of acoustical and thermal insulation products, to help it enter the health care and education sectors. Skilled Manufacturing and SoundTech intend to remain suppliers to the auto industry, a strategy Hill said is typical of companies that diversify. "As long as there is such an industry, we want to remain part of it," Skilled Manufacturing's Russell said. "If you can weather the storms, it's a very good business." Analysts say auto suppliers have shown more resiliency than many expected even a year ago. Hill attributed that to a mix of cost-cutting, improved pricing power, court-supervised restructurings and government aid. James Gillette, a supplier expert with CSM Worldwide, an auto market forecasting service in Northville, said large suppliers "came out with a whole laundry list of strategies to save themselves." Only a few of the biggest tier one suppliers, such as Collins & Aikman and Metaldyne Inc., have disappeared, he said. Other firms that were struggling to restructure their debt have found some relief. Livonia-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp., a producer of vehicle control systems, has raised almost $1.2 billion in equity, bonds and term loans since August, Gillette said. Watching the auto industry Grand Rapids-based IRN Inc.'s seventh biennial supplier survey found that 80 percent of suppliers now say they can break even or make money with U.S. car and truck sales of 10.5 million vehicles annually. "At a minimum, that's probably what we're looking at," said Kim Korth, founder and president of IRN, an automotive market researcher. "And when it returns to any degree of normalcy, which most people believe is a 13 million- or 14 million-unit year, and you have a cost structure that can break even or make money at 10.5 million, you can then see how profitability is likely to improve over time." Hill said bankruptcy and other pressures have helped North American suppliers such as Visteon Corp., Ford Motor Co.'s former parts unit, to bring down costs. "A lot of us are watching for how many suppliers return when auto production cranks up again," Hill said. "It's only then we will really know how many suppliers were able to scale back and wait, or ... simply went out of business, or moved on to another business." laguilar@detnews.com (313) 222-2760

Lafayette. Karen Irene Schwarck, age 59, a longtime South Lyon resident who moved to Mackinac Island four years ago, and her sister, Edith Rayner Bonno, 57, of Canton Township, had been taking photographs and riding together on a snowmobile which police said slid off a road on West Bluff Drive. Schwarck's husband, Donald, notified police about 10 p.m. Sunday when the two women had not returned home and four hours later, searchers found them at the base of the steep hill. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. The Schwarcks were married for 38 years and Karen, an artist and writer, owned and operated her own travel agency, Escapades Tours, for 17 years. She was a founding director of the South Lyon Senior Citizen Center. Besides her husband, Schwarck is survived by sons, Matt Schwarck of Lake Orion and Paul Schwarck of Chicago. Karen and Edith are also survived by their parents, Eric and Irene Rayner of Naples, Fla.; and a brother, Eric Rayner of Brighton. Edith is survived by her children, Jessica Rayner Garrett and Joshua Bonno, and two grandchildren. Visitation will be from 4-8 p.m. today and Friday at Phillips Funeral Home, 122 W. Lake St., in South Lyon. The family will receive friends at 10:15 a.m. Saturday at First United Methodist Church, and the memorial service will begin at 11 a.m. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the family of Karen Schwarck and Edith Bonno c/o Phillips Funeral Home, 122 W.

2019-09-13 02:16:05,486 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - ROTHBURY -- Chris Larson was all but certain the animal with a large, lean body and sloping tail she recently saw prowling near her friend's Rothbury home was a cougar. Wildlife experts from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment have another name for the animal Larson spotted on Friday -- a large house cat. "The track and photo evidence are very consistent with a large, domestic house cat," Pete Kailing, a field biologist at the DNRE's Baldwin office, wrote in a report after investigating Larson's claim. Kailing noted the tracks were "too small for bobcat, and much too small for even an immature cougar." Whether cougars live in Michigan has generated intense debate across the state. Scores of residents say they've spotted cougars, but the DNRE -- the state agency tasked with investigating cougar sightings -- has never found evidence that the animals have reached Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The DNRE has confirmed cougars have reached the Upper Peninsula, but there is no evidence the animals have established a breeding population. At 1.25 by 1.5 inches, the animal's footprints were far smaller than those of a cougar, which typically reach 3.5 by 4 inches, said DNRE spokeswoman Mary Dettloff. The animal's stride -- 9 inches in length -- also was far smaller than a cougar's, which ranges from 15 to 28 inches, depending on size and maturity, she said. Photos of the animal's footprints were examined by other DNRE staff members trained to spot cougars. Larson stands by her claim. "I feel in my heart that this is definitely not a house cat," Larson said, adding she knows what cougars look like and doesn't have poor eyesight. "I know what I saw." Larson spotted the animal near the backyard of a friend's home in the 7000 block of Maria Street in Rothbury. When Kailing stopped at the address to examine the footprints, he said they led to a nearby mobile home park where other cat tracks could be seen. No claw marks were evident on the prints, which are common on cougar prints, Dettloff said.

2019-09-13 02:16:07,490 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - NORTON SHORES -- For 17 years, General Dynamics Land Systems has provided Bob Hoeltzel with a good-paying job and allowed him to stay in West Michigan, a region he's proud to call home. Now, in the wake of the company's decision to close its Muskegon Technical Center on June 14, Hoeltzel and about 100 other employees face a tough call: Do they uproot their lives and transfer to the defense contractor's headquarters in the Detroit area so they can save their jobs? "I've passed up promotions to stay here," said Hoeltzel, 58, of Twin Lake. "This is bad news for Muskegon." In a hit to the Muskegon area, which already is struggling with high unemployment, General Dynamics announced Monday it would close the Muskegon Technical Center. Consolidating operations will help strengthen the company's performance, officials said. About 100 employees -- mostly well-paid engineers -- must decide by Monday whether to take a position at the company's headquarters in Sterling Heights or another Macomb County facility in Shelby Township, said spokeswoman Rae Higgins. Four employees will lose their jobs. "While it does seem like a short time frame to make the decision, we have members of our human resources transition team on hand to answer questions," Higgins said. Those who don't choose to transfer will lose their jobs, she said. Norton Shores Mayor Gary Nelund said the decision is a blow to the city. "It shows, more importantly, just how important the role of economic development is as we struggle with declining revenue," Nelund said. "It shows how important it is to work with and for individual businesses within our city." The move, Higgins said, won't affect workers' pay or benefits. Employees could be in their new positions by early to mid-May. Consolidating operations will help General Dynamics "better align the enterprise and position it for the future. "GDLS will concentrate complementary strengths in the Sterling Heights/Shelby area to maximize internal innovative capability," Higgins said. "We believe this requires an empowered team in southeast Michigan in close proximity to our major U.S. military customers." Cindy Larsen, president of the Muskegon Area Chamber of Commerce, was disappointed. "It's a little surprising in that these are exactly the types of jobs we've been attracting in recent years," she said. "The area is growing in the high-tech engineering side of manufacturing in recent years." Larsen wishes the company would have discussed the move with the chamber. "If you're working for an organization whose key decision makers aren't located in Muskegon, it's very important that you reach out to the chamber or Muskegon Area First on how to put together a proposal to retain jobs locally," she said. "We can help you put together a proposal that will demonstrate that Muskegon is a low-cost location."

2019-09-13 02:16:09,491 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - BY DOUG Guthrie The Detroit News River Rouge — A minister who police say has a reputation for reaching out to troubled teens was charged Monday with six counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct for allegedly having sex with an under-aged boy. The Rev. Russell Schaller, 35, of River Rouge, senior pastor at Greater St. Johns Missionary Baptist Church on Detroit's east side, was arraigned in 26th District Court and ordered held in the Wayne County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bond. Schaller is a River Rouge resident and the events he is accused of took place there over the past six months with a youth under the age of 16, police said. "There have been other accusations over the years from other communities around here," River Rouge Police Chief Robert Alderman said. "Now that he's locked up, we believe others will step forward. We definitely believe there are other victims. In our initial contact with him, he told an officer, 'Age ain't nothing but a number to me.'[UTF8]E28082[/UTF8]" Schaller describes himself on his Internet site as "different" from other religious types. Statements attributed to Schaller on his Myspace page include: "Hymn books are made to throw at people who fall asleep. Not a religious freak. Can have a conversation without ever bring in church or God." Alderman said Schaller has temporarily taken numerous troubled teens into his home over the past several years. Alderman asked people with information about Schaller to call the River Rouge Police Department at (313) 842-8700. "Now it's just a matter of finding out who is willing to come forward now that he is locked up and they are safe," Alderman said. "This may encourage some parents to talk to us." Schaller was ordered to be returned to court on Feb. 19 for a preliminary examination of the evidence authorities claim to have against him. If convicted, Schaller faces imprisonment of up to 15 years. dguthrie@detnews.com (313) 222-2548

2019-09-13 02:16:11,494 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Jennifer Chambers The Detroit News Pontiac — Once Teacher's Pet is in session, it's hard to tell the difference between the teachers and the students. A dozen teens from Oakland County's Children's Village are paired with a handful of rambunctious dogs from Oakland Pet Adoption. Both need help to make a better life for themselves on the outside. The teens, placed by the courts into the Oakland County facility for troubled youth and juvenile offenders, have been challenged with the task of training the dogs — who have lingered at the shelter because of behavioral problems — into well-behaved, adoptable pets. The pets are there to offer unconditional love to youngsters in the criminal justice system. The animal-assisted therapy program is also in place at the Macomb County Juvenile Justice Center in Mount Clemens, the Kingsley Montgomery School in Waterford and at Crossroads for Youth in Oxford. Teacher's Pet creator Amy Johnson said during the 12-week program, the teens learn the basics of animal handling, identifying stress in dogs and why it's important to be able to put yourself in the dog's "paws." They work on performing commands such as "sit," "stay," "down" and "leave it"; how to walk on a leash; and to not jump on people. "We talk about body language of the dogs, humane responsibility of dog ownership. If we can talk about stress in dogs, we can talk about stress in kids," Johnson said. "We never have to say the program is for them. They are there to help the dogs." It is through the power of the human-animal bond that the teens, many of whom are struggling with gangs and problems at home, are able to experience their own personal growth and behavioral improvements, officials say. "These kids are getting treatment they don't even realize they are getting," said Laura Beale, a Children's Village supervisor. "It teaches them compassion, teamwork, to help each other, even though the 'others' are animals." At a recent training session, the teens retrieved their dogs from animal shelter cages, attached their leashes and used small treats as rewards for well-performed commands. The dogs wagged their tails and the teens took a moment to kneel to whisper encouragement. "It's like having your own kid," one 18-year-old said, stroking the head of his canine student. "Dogs need as much attention, caring and friendship as anybody else." Kids say the program helps them understand second chances, Johnson said. "One girl said the dog wasn't interested in her but the more she worked with the dog, the more it trusted her. It made her feel like her mom could trust her, too," Beale said. "We learn how to communicate with the dogs so they can be better trainers. These are real skills they can take into the community when they are released." jchambers@detnews.com (734) 462-2289

2019-09-13 02:16:13,503 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By David Shepardson Detroit News Washington Bureau Washington — Toyota Motor Corp. will resume production at six North American assembly plants today as it plans to announce a fix for brake problems on its third-generation Prius. Toyota spokesman Mike Michels said the company has enough replacement pedals to begin turning out vehicles. "There are sufficient repair parts for customer cars as well as a reserve of pedals from last week's stoppage that we can begin production," he said Sunday. The automaker halted production at factories in Canada, Indiana, Kentucky and Texas. Toyota plans to recall 311,000 third-generation Prius vehicles worldwide — including about 100,000 in the United States — mutiple media outlets reported in Japan late Sunday. The automaker in the United States didn't deny the reports, but wouldn't confirm them. A Transportation Department spokeswoman said Sunday the agency hadn't received any official notification from Toyota. After Toyota recalled 2.3 million vehicles on Jan. 21, it was forced to stop selling eight models accounting for nearly 60 percent of their sales volume on Jan. 26. The company's dealers have begun selling models in the showroom on a "vehicle by vehicle" basis as they make repairs to the pedal assembly. Last week, the company's dealers began fixing thousands of the recalled vehicles, with some staying open 24 hours a day to accommodate customers. Toyota on Sunday morning began airing spots on U.S. television saying that the company is "working around the clock" to build the highest-quality vehicles and to restore the faith of its customers. The company made a change to the software of the Prius braking system last month to resolve the issue, but hasn't said how it will address vehicles sold previously. Michels didn't deny plans to recall the Prius. "Until something is filed with NHTSA, it would be premature to announce anything for the U.S.," he said late Sunday. Toyota said Sunday that it will soon announce plans to deal with the Prius braking problems. The automaker decided Saturday on a recall in Japan covering its latest Prius model and has notified domestic dealers, Japan's largest newspaper, the Yomiuri, reported without naming sources. It said Toyota would announce the move early this week after consulting with the Japanese government. Japan's Kyodo News agency and TV Asahi carried similar reports. Kyodo said Toyota had started notifying dealers, and that at least 170,000 vehicles in Japan would be subject to the recall. Toyota told U.S. dealers Friday that it was quickly moving toward finding "a solution for existing customers" — but didn't say if it would be a recall, service bulletin or service campaign. Prius drivers in Japan and the United States have complained of a short delay before the car's antilock brakes kick in — a flaw Toyota says can be fixed with a software programming change. The brakes will work if the driver keeps pushing the pedal. U.S. and Japanese auto safety regulator are investigating. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has received 124 complaints, including reports of four accidents, with two minor injuries. Company officials are working on the testimony of its North American president Yoshimi Inaba, who will testify Wednesday along with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and NHTSA administrator David Strickland in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform. A Toyota official confirmed that Toyota has hired Glover Park Group — a strategic communications group — to help the company during its crisis that was sparked by its handling of two massive recalls over gas pedal issues that now is about 9 million vehicles worldwide.

2019-09-13 02:16:15,502 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Oralandar Brand-Williams The Detroit News Detroit — Sounds of classical music filled Orchestra Hall on Sunday as young musicians from around the country competed in the 13th Annual Sphinx Competition for young black and Latino string players. The Sphinx Organization, founded in Detroit in 1996, was formed to increase the numbers of black and Latino musicians in the classical music field. Many of the foundation's alumni have performed in top orchestras worldwide. The top three contenders in the senior division and the winner of the junior division performed in the Finals Concert at Orchestra Hall, bringing the audience to its feet several times for for the classical music offerings of Mozart, Saint-Saens, Bartok and Abels. Twenty-four-year-old Gareth Johnson of Wellington, Fla., took first place in the senior competition. The second-place winner was 20-year-old Paul Laraia of Boston; and John Sanderson, a 20-year-old Indiana resident, finished third. Thirteen-year-old Randall Goosby of Bartlett, Tenn., won first prize in the junior division of the national competition. He received $5,000 and a chance to perform with several national orchestras. The young musicians performed before a sold-out crowd of an estimated 1,800 people. Johnson, who has performed as a soloist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, said he felt "on top of the world" from Sunday's win, which includes a record contract. "I've been planning for this for two years," said Johnson of his Sunday performance. Johnson said he started playing violin at the age of 10. "I've always loved music," he said. Johnson plans to audition next month for a music program at the Julliard School in New York. As part of his audition to the school, he will perform in front of violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman. Jerome Sanderson, the father of third-place winner John Sanderson, praised the efforts of the Sphinx Organization to foster racial and ethnic diversity in the classical music arena by helping younger musicians of color fine-tune their craft. "The Sphinx Organization is providing role models," said Jerome Sanderson. "You see blacks and Latinos achieving great heights and musical excellence." Aaron Dworkin, founder and president of the Sphinx Organization, said while his foundation has made some progress in bringing diversity to classical music and orchestras around the country, there is still "a long way to go." "What is exciting is we've had an impact over the past 13 years ... we're beginning to see a change," said Dworkin, who noted that blacks and Latinos still make up a tiny percentage of orchestral musicians and composers. "But we still have a lot of work to do still."

2019-09-13 02:16:17,508 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Mark Hornbeck Detroit News Lansing Bureau The ad wars in Michigan's race for governor officially kicked off Sunday with a 60-second commercial for Republican candidate Rick Snyder that started on the Super Bowl pregame show and will cost at least $1 million. The spot, called "one tough nerd," highlights Snyder's formative years in Battle Creek, his college days at the University of Michigan and his career as chief of the Gateway Inc. computer company and other ventures. "Michigan has tried career politicians. We've tried happy talk. And, we're 50th out of 50. Dead last," a voice-over says, referring to the state's 14.6 percent jobless rate, last in the nation. The ad shows photos of several gubernatorial candidates, including those of Snyder's Republican opponents. "His 10-point plan to reinvent Michigan is so detailed that; well, it's likely no politician could even understand it," the narrator continues. "But, it's the way to finally save our state," Snyder says. And the voice-over concludes: "Rick Snyder for Michigan. He's one tough nerd." The ad will run for two weeks in most Michigan markets and was "a seven-figure buy," said Jake Suski, spokesman for the Snyder camp. It was produced by Strategic Perception Inc. of Hollywood, Calif. Campaign finance records show the Ann Arbor businessman is the leading fundraiser among gubernatorial candidates at $3.2 million, including $2.7 million of his own money. His early commercial buy mirrors that of Republican Dick DeVos four years ago. DeVos stayed on the air from February to November, and he spent a record $35 million. Other Republican candidates are Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard, Attorney General Mike Cox, state Sen. Tom George of Kalamazoo and U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Holland. On the Democratic side, state Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith is in the race, Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero is expected to announce today, House Speaker Andy Dillon of Redford Township has formed an exploratory committee and Detroit businesswoman Denise Ilitch, ex-state Treasurer Bob Bowman and ex-Genesee County Treasurer Dan Kildee are considering a run.

2019-09-13 02:16:19,506 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - HOLLAND -- As popular as the Holland Community Aquatic Center has been with competitive swimmers and with families looking for a place to have fun, Tom Bos is most pleased that the center still continues to offer swimming lessons to every child in the Holland school district. "That's the centerpiece of what we do," he said. Bos, 61, will retire at the end of June after 25 years as executive director of the Aquatic Center and its predecessor, the Holland Community Swimming Pool. Greg Oppenhuizen, who chairs the authority that oversees the aquatic center, credits Bos for his vision and energy in helping make the center's construction possible. "He was the one who took the bull by the horns and put together the initial community task force to investigate what we wanted and needed in terms of aquatics," Oppenhuizen said. In 1996, Holland voters overwhelmingly approved an $11.25 million bond issue that allowed the aquatic center to be built. The nearly 87,000-square-foot facility, which includes an Olympic-size pool for competitive races, a heated therapy pool, an exercise room and a children's water play area known as the Splash Zone, opened three years later, with more than 206,000 visits its first year. "Usually this type of facility and what we do here, you don't see unless it's in a major metropolitan area, like St. Louis or Chicago," said Don Kimble, the center's director of competitive programs and swimming coach at Holland High School. Making a splash Located just two blocks south of Holland Hospital, the center has worked closely with the hospital on therapy programs. Jennifer Werley, a physical therapist for the hospital's rehabilitation services, credits Bos for his willingness to work to make opportunities available for hospital patients to extend their physical therapy program by using the center's facilities. "It provides a lot of continuity of care after physical therapy is finished to have the pool there," Werley said. "As we've grown our program and included pediatric therapy, he's allowed us to use different areas of the pool." Oppenhuizen also credits Bos for lobbying state lawmakers to pass a law allowing Holland to establish a swimming pool authority after the passage of Proposal A in 1995 prevented the Holland Public Schools from having a separate millage for pool operations. Visitors flock to pools The aquatic center, which received more than 237,000 visits last year, operates on a $2 million budget, half of which is covered by an operating millage that comes up for renewal next year, the rest by revenues generated by admission fees, memberships, classes and pool rentals. "The community, I'm certain, realizes we've done good things for the whole community, and they come out and support it," Bos said. Bos graduated from Hope College in 1970 with a degree in chemistry and later earned a master's degree at Michigan State University. Bos taught middle school and high school science in the Holland district for 14 years before replacing Ron Howard as executive director of what was then the Holland Community Swimming Pool in 1984. He also coached the Holland High boys' swimming team from 1970-1994, and also coached the Dutch girls' swimming team for years. Under Bos' leadership, the aquatic center was chosen as the best indoor public/nonprofit facility in the nation by Aquatics International magazine in 2004. It will host the Michigan High School Athletic Association state Division 2 boys swimming and diving championships next month, and hosted the NCAA Division III men's and women's national championships in 2006. The aquatic center will host the Michigan High School Athletic Association state boys' swimming finals next month.

2019-09-13 02:16:21,509 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Louis Aguilar The Detroit News A decades-long dream by local Greek business leaders to create a museum celebrating their heritage appears close to reality. The group has purchased the former Children's Museum in Detroit's cultural district and intends to convert it into the Hellenic Museum of Michigan. Last month, the museum organizers bought the 67 E. Kirby building, between the Park Shelton and the International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit, from Wayne State University for $355,000. They offered a sneak peek of the space during Noel Night last weekend. The museum could be open permanently by the middle of next year, organizers said. "We've been discussing this and working on this for so long, and to be honest, much more hard work now comes because now we have bought the building," said John Korachis, a Detroit attorney who is among those leading the effort. Ernest Zachary, who heads a Midtown urban planning and development firm, is another principal in the effort. The Greek business group said Comerica Inc. and Detroit Renaissance, soon to be called Business Leaders for Michigan, provided loans to help buy the building. The museum intends to spend $166,000 on construction and initial programming development. The effort has been largely driven by the successful Greek entrepreneurs in Metro Detroit, Zachary and Korachis said. Zachary said the intent is to highlight the accomplishments and history of the area's Greek community, expose visitors to its culture and inspire future generations of dreamers and entrepreneurs. "There are so many Greek success stories in the area, and they remain loyal to the area," Zachary said. Among them are Compuware CEO Peter Karmanos, Greektown Casino founders Dimitrios "Jim" Papas and Ted Gatzaros, the small businesses that formed the Greektown entertainment area decades ago, and numerous small business owners, attorneys, academics, politicians and others. Korachis said the building's purchase came months sooner than expected because Wayne State University was eager to sell. Now the organizers are "working like crazy between our day jobs" to ensure things go as planned. "We're trying to be cautious and make sure everything we announce will actually come true," Korachis said. The new cultural center is counting on the local Greek community for financial support, organizers said. The Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Detroit estimates there are more than 200,000 Greek Orthodox Christians in Metro Detroit. A Greek community began to take root in the area almost a century ago. The Hellenic Museum would include a permanent exhibition chronicling the story of Detroit's Greek immigrants, a cafe, a meeting center and a partnership with Wayne State University that would enhance its modern Greek program. "It is easy to foresee many good uses for the proposed Hellenic Museum of Michigan," said Margaret Winters, chairwoman of WSU's Department of Classical and Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures. That would include expanding its summer study abroad program, scholarships and routine symposiums at the museum. laguilar@detnews.com (313) 222-2760

2019-09-13 02:16:23,513 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- The precise details of a Jewish revolt 160 years before the birth of Jesus -- and the ensuing miraculous rededication of the Jerusalem temple that gave rise to an annual eight-day celebration called Hanukkah -- are not at the forefront of Karen Libman's mind this week. Instead, as the local woman lights her family's menorah to commemorate the holiday that began Friday night, she sees a symbol of a modern-day battle between good and evil. "It's a beautiful ritual. The idea of bringing light at the time of the year when it's most dark is so symbolic," said Libman, chairwoman of the religious life committee at Congregation Ahavas Israel, a Grand Rapids synagogue. "The commemoration of the miracle of Hanukkah is a commemoration of the miracle of light in darkness. We know that light can come to darkness, that peace can still prevail in the world." Despite sharing the same season, Hanukkah stands apart from Christmas both in its origin and observance. Still, gift-giving plays an increased role in the holiday known for its dreidels and latkes. And though there is a religious underpinning that dates back more than two millennia to a Jewish military victory, it is really a "party holiday" when "you get to eat fun, greasy food," Libman said. "For me, the basic message of Hanukkah is a time to get together with people that you care about," said Mark Binder, a Rhode Island storyteller who was to perform Friday at a Temple Emanuel holiday dinner in Grand Rapids. "People take religion very seriously today and I have to laugh about it. It's sad that we're fighting wars about religion still, as far as I'm concerned. "I like to say that I'm Jewish the way (20th-century novelist William) Faulkner is southern. When I tell a story, my objective is to transmit joy." Binder starting writing Hanukkah stories several years ago and was a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award with "A Hanukkah Present," a fictional account of how gift-giving became part of the holiday's culture. He also tells "Lethal Latkes," a story about a bad batch of the prized potato pancakes often consumed during Hanukkah, and several other Hanukkah tales. The historical Hanukkah story dates to 200 B.C., when the Jewish temple was rededicated after rebel guerrillas ousted a foreign oppressor intent on eradicating Jewish customs. As the story goes, there was only enough olive oil to light the temple's eternal flame, the symbol of God's presence, for one day. Miraculously, the flame burned for eight days, long enough for a new batch of oil to be pressed. Hence, the Hanukkah roles of oily latkes and the dreidel, a four-sided spinning top with a Hebrew letter on each face to form an acronym for the phrase "a great miracle happened there." "There's not a huge religious component (to Hanukkah), but there's certainly a festive air to the holiday," said Rabbi Michael Schadick, Temple Emanuel rabbi. "On one hand, Hanukkah is a celebration of a military victory, that when the defeat occurred they went back into the temple and they cleaned it up. "The custom is to make known the miracle of the holiday by placing a menorah in the window. Throughout Jewish history, this menorah has always been a symbol of a better or brighter tomorrow. It's a symbol that there's hope even in times of darkness."

2019-09-13 02:16:25,516 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- When Thomas Pauli froze to death early this year next to a car in an auto salvage yard, his friends were outraged that state law prevented the convicted sex offender from taking shelter at local missions. Now, in the aftermath of the 52-year-old's death amid frigid temperatures, a move is under way to clarify a law that prohibits registered sex offenders from residing anywhere within 1,000 feet of a school or day care. "No one, regardless of what they have done, deserves death on the street like that," said Miriam Aukerman, a Legal Aid of Western Michigan attorney taking up the legal battle on behalf of area homeless advocates. Among the local agencies supporting the effort are Mel Trotter and Degage ministries, the Servants Center, Salvation Army, Grand Rapids Area Coalition to End Homelessness, Guiding Light Mission and Bethlehem Lutheran Church. Aukerman recently asked Michigan State Police Director Peter Munoz, whose agency oversees the state's Sex Offender Registry, to look at whether shelters should be considered the "residence" of a homeless person. Munoz declined to rule, saying the state police primarily only keeps the computerized database of offenders. Aukerman now plans to ask a court to issue a decision. Turned away Pauli, convicted in 1991 of molesting a pre-teen girl, reportedly tried to get into Guiding Light Mission or Mel Trotter Ministries the night before his death but was turned away because of the state law. Officials from the missions could not confirm Pauli tried to get in but could not rule it out, either and, last January, said they were obligated to turn away known sex offenders on the registry. As winter weather returns, the issue is important to local homeless advocates who do not want to see any deaths similar to Pauli's. "I think it was an unfortunate turn of events with Mr. Pauli," said Chico Daniels, director of Mel Trotter. "I would not like to put people out in the streets. We are in this business of providing hope for those who would otherwise be without, but at the same time, we have an obligation to obey the law. "It's a real tug-of-war for us," he said. As temperatures dipped into the low teens Thursday night, Mel Trotter Vice President of Programs Bill Merchut said the mission would rely on the homeless to identify whether they are sex offenders and would not ask questions. "Both (men's) missions have said that, in this weather, we are going to be available," he said. Not a permanent residence Aukerman filed the request for a "declaratory ruling" with the state police on behalf of a 49-year-old man with a sex conviction from 20 years ago and a 23-year-old developmentally disabled woman convicted of a sexual touching crime. Both are concerned about being turned away from local missions in the winter, she said. Aukerman argues shelters are not a permanent residence for the homeless and are simply "night by night" accommodations. Homeless men generally have to leave both missions before 8 a.m. for the day. "They bring their bags of things with them and they have to take their property the next day," she said. "It's much more akin to staying in a hotel." Aukerman also argued that, since all of the emergency shelters in Grand Rapids are within 1,000 feet of a school, the state law "effectively criminalizes homelessness." She does not believe the Legislature intended "homeless people to freeze to death." "We want to make sure the law is clear and no one suffers the same fate Mr. Pauli did," she said.

2019-09-13 02:16:27,519 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Mark Hornbeck and Christine Macdonald The Detroit News Lansing — Michigan will become the 38th state to ban smoking in public places on May 1, following passage Thursday of the prohibition by the House and Senate and a vow from Gov. Jennifer Granholm to sign the bill. The long-awaited smoking ban makes exceptions for the gaming floors at the three Detroit casinos, cigar bars, specialty tobacco shops, home offices and motor vehicles, including commercial trucks. The legislation won overwhelming passage in both chambers after more than a year of haggling over whether there should be exemptions. Smoking will be banned in workplaces and food service establishments, including bars, restaurants, food courts at shopping malls, cafeterias and private clubs. Violators face fines of $100 for a first offense and $500 for subsequent ones. "We're finally dealing with the secondhand smoke issue that has plagued this state for many years," said Sen. Ray Basham, D-Taylor, who has been pushing a smoking ban for most of a decade. Granholm called the move a "terrific gift to Michigan." But not everyone was happy — especially bar owners and the 20.4 percent of residents who light up in Michigan. Nationwide, 18.4 percent do. "It's stupid. It violates smokers' rights," said Drew Dobt, as he smoked a cigar in downtown Detroit. "That's why you go (out) — to smoke and drink." An amendment calling for a total ban was rejected in the Senate because the House has opposed that version. Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop, R-Rochester, called the measure a "blatant overreach by government into the private business environment." And Lance Binoniemi, president of the Michigan Licensed Beverage Association, said it will cost thousands of jobs. "Michigan taxpayers will be outraged when they hear our elected officials passed a smoking ban that they have acknowledged will cripple our hospitality industry," Binoniemi said, noting that about a third of the state's bars and restaurants — about 6,000 — have already voluntarily gone smoke-free. Ban expected to save money The state also could lose about $27.5 million in tobacco tax revenue from smokers who quit because of the ban, but will save money on medical costs, according to a House Fiscal Agency analysis. Over time, the ban will reduce smoking by 5 percent to 20 percent; and the state will save $6.4 million for every percentage point in Medicaid costs that are reduced as a result of the dropoff in smoking, according to the analysis. Sen. Tom George, R-Kalamazoo, a physician, said cutting smoking is "probably the biggest thing we can do to become a healthier state." Polls show 70 percent of residents support the ban, said Sen. Ron Jelinek, R-Three Oaks. "When it comes down to it, it's just something that makes sense for Michigan," said Susan Schechter, directory of advocacy for the American Lung Association Michigan chapter. "It's long overdue." Loophole battle emerged The ban faced opposition from the Michigan Licensed Beverage Association, Detroit bar and restaurant owners and some lawmakers who object to an exemption allowing smoking in the three Detroit casinos. Proponents of the loophole argued the casinos needed to compete with tribal facilities, where the law wouldn't apply. Jamaine Dickens, a spokesman for MGM Grand Casino in Detroit, said the exemption prevented 2,100 layoffs at the city's casinos. Although restaurant owners objected, the ban could help business because nonsmokers will go out more often, said Jelinek, who shepherded the bill through the Senate. John Colbert, an owner of Baker's Keyboard Lounge in Detroit, agreed. He said he often gets calls from those who ask if the landmark jazz club is smoke-free. "Health is an issue," Colbert said. "People who don't come now, will probably come." Others seemed resigned to the ban. "We fought for so many years, I guess we have lost the fight and need to deal with it and move on," said Toby Brown of Pinz Bowling Center in South Lyon, who worries the law will drive folks away from night-time league bowling. "We knew it was going to happen sooner or later." mhornbeck@detnews.com (313) 222-2470 Darren A. Nichols contributed.

2019-09-13 02:16:29,520 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Jaclyn Trop The Detroit News On Saturday, it will be a little easier to shop in Detroit. Detroit Synergy's sixth annual Shop Detroit event kicks off at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Compuware Building on Campus Martius and runs until 4 p.m. The one-day-only holiday shopping bonanza is expected to draw more than 300 people, who can take complimentary shuttle buses from Compuware to Midtown, New Center and Eastern Market to explore the city's retail treasures. The shopping tour will highlight urban shops and restaurants in all three neighborhoods, as well as downtown. "Everybody says there's no place to do any shopping in Detroit, which is not true," event organizer Jen Ruud said. In Midtown, shuttle buses will bring shoppers to independent outposts such as accessory and home goods retailers City Bird and Bureau of Urban Living on West Canfield Street. New Center attractions include Pure Detroit, the Girl Scout Shop and City Knits. At Eastern Market, shoppers can trawl the Rocky Peanut Company, Supino's Pizza and R Hirt Jr. Co. Downtown, shoppers can visit Hugh, a men's gift shop on Park Avenue; Blumz, a floral shop on Broadway; and African-influenced boutique Djenne Beads & Art in Greektown. Shop Detroit events include a gift basket demonstration at Eastern Market; a fashion show at the Renaissance Center; and a craft show, free gift wrapping and a Detroit Children's Choir performance at the Fisher Building. Shoppers will receive a directory of retailers, neighborhood maps and information on discounts and promotions upon checking in at Compuware headquarters. The first 100 pre-registered shoppers will receive a reusable shopping tote, normally $1. Shoppers who arrive early also will receive free People Mover tokens. Inside Detroit, a nonprofit visitor's bureau and tour company, is sponsoring the shuttle service and will be holding a Shop Detroit pub crawl at 4 p.m. If you go What: Shop Detroit annual holiday event When: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday Where: Kick-off at Campus Martius with shuttles to Midtown, New Center and Eastern Market Information: Visit detroitsynergy.org/projects/shopdetroit. jtrop@detnews.com (313) 222-2300

2019-09-13 02:16:31,526 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - Local educators say they likely will proceed with plans to make millions of dollars in cuts to staff and programs, even though Gov. Jennifer Granholm is holding off on a $127 per-student cut of state aid to school districts. Area superintendents are encouraged that Granholm says there is more money in state coffers than was projected -- but don't know for sure that the state cuts won't go through later in the year. "The bottom line is that the Legislature has been irresponsible, and that includes the governor and both parties," Rockford Public Schools Superintendent Michael Shibler said Thursday. "And if it turns out that the governor was using the K-12 students as pawns, that's just beyond disappointing." Granholm said revenues from property taxes was about $100 million more than projected. About $50 million was saved when schools cut programs that would have required state matching funds, and $30 million will come from Michigan's participation in the multistate Powerball lottery. That means money that would have been sliced from Dec. 21 payments to school districts will be restored, at least until after a Jan. 11 meeting at which economists estimate how much money the state can expect to raise in 2010 and 2011. "The amount of money that we're talking about is so much to the good that we had asked the Department of Education to pause the reduced checks for this month until we get the final numbers," Granholm said in a news conference. The move brought charges from Republicans in the state Legislature that Granholm, a Democrat, only demanded the cuts to twist arms and rally school groups to support raising taxes. Her move came on the heels of a $165 per-student decrease from the Legislature, a one-two punch that stunned educators. "I said at the time that it was inappropriate for the governor to take that action until she knew how much money was going to be there," said state Sen. Wayne Kuipers, R-Holland. "It was definitely an attempt by her to box us in. And she did this by herself. There were no accomplices." Granholm said Thursday she wasn't scaremongering "We still have a structure that is inadequate and too recession-sensitive," the governor said. And unless the federal government kicks in more money for the 2011 year, "we're going to present a budget in 2011 that will have horrible cuts." Granholm told Kent County school leaders Oct. 23 she wanted to extend the sales tax to services and close loopholes that save money for special interests. She also said changes are needed to Proposal A, the landmark school finance reform that shifted school funding from property taxes to a mix of property and sales taxes. "I know people are battle-weary. I'm battle-weary," she told the group. Shibler said he has tired of lawmakers' inability to get a budget in place, even with school districts six months into the fiscal year. The Rockford school board Monday is voting on $2.7 million in cuts, $1.7 million stemming from the now-paused $127 per-student decrease. Many districts already have approved midyear reductions, including Byron Center, which cut 12 teachers, and Comstock Park, which eliminated 4.5 positions. Shibler said he will proceed because contracts require set times to notify employees of changes planned for the start of the second semester. "I can rescind the changes later and bring people back when we know for sure the money is going to be there," he said. "We know the state is in a world of hurt. They need to fix the problem. "Look at the effect this is having on people and families, the anxiety for the kids and their parents. Look at the teachers in Byron Center and Comstock Park and all the others out there."

2019-09-13 02:16:33,529 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- Allowing medical marijuana sales from the homes of those who grow it is preferable to allowing stand-alone marijuana dispensaries, City Planning Director Suzanne Schulz said Thursday. "We are going to have people doing it anyway," Schultz told the city's Planning Commission. The commission tabled the matter, vowing to discuss it next month despite several members who said they were aghast at the prospect of allowing marijuana distribution in neighborhoods. "Obviously it's an emotional issue," Commission Vice Chairman Paul Potter said. "We have to educate ourselves, or we will make a decision that is not fact-based." Schulz said her proposal to allow home distribution would allow the city to outlaw larger dispensaries that could cause problems. State law approved last year allows distribution by state-licensed caregivers who are limited to five patients each. Caregivers are allowed to raise 12 marijuana plants for each one of their patients. Not allowing home distribution would open the city to accusations it was illegally outlawing a legitimate business, Schulz said. The state law allows licensed caregivers to supply marijuana to patients who get recommendations from medical doctors for a handful of diseases such as AIDs, chemotherapy reactions and seizures. To date, the state has issued 6,125 medical marijuana patient registrations and has registered 2,572 caregivers, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. The ordinance proposed by Schulz also would allow distribution from pharmacies, medical clinics or doctors' offices. Although pharmacists and doctors are barred from distributing marijuana by federal law, Schulz said the ordinance would allow caregivers to use their facilities for distribution. The ordinance also could accommodate changes in federal law, she said. The Grand Rapids Police Department is opposed to having marijuana dispensaries in neighborhoods, Sgt. Holly Botts said. Complying with the law will be difficult for police because they won't be able to determine which marijuana distributors are legitimate, said Botts, who works in the vice unit.

But you also want it to have an environmental conscious, to be clean and fuel-efficient. Ford and General Motors have created show cars they think will help you as you plan your own vehicle. Ford's project was a classic 1934 three-window coupe-based hot rod. GM used a 1955 Chevrolet as its canvas. Ford worked in partnership with Detroit Street Rods and Experi-metal Inc. to insert one of Ford's new 3.5-liter EcoBoost twin-turbocharged V-6 engines, the powerplant used in the 2010 Ford Taurus SHO, into one of the all-steel, '34 Ford three-window coupes produced by Experi-metal in Sterling Heights. Technosports Inc. of Livonia also played a major role, repackaging the turbochargers and doing the exhaust development and other plumbing so the engine, used by Ford in front-wheel-drive vehicles, could send its power — 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque — through a Tremac TKO five-speed manual gearbox and 9-inch Ford differential to the hot rod's rear wheels. Several Detroit area automotive specialty shops were involved, including Kustom Creations Inc. of Sterling Heights, which did the Planet Color paint, and Shelby Trim, also of Sterling Heights, which did the Ivory leather interior with Tomato red piping. GM's showcase for an emission-legal high-performance classic is called the E-Rod, and was created using the 1955 Chevrolet two-door sedan that GM Performance Parts uses to develop classic car components. Power comes from GM Performance Parts' 6.2-liter LS3 V-8 crate engine, which in standard guise provides 430 horsepower and 424 foot-pounds of torque, yet has emissions approval from the California Air Resources Board (C.A.R.B.). GM fine-tuned the engine for the '55 Chevy E-Rod application to bump output to nearly 450 hp. The engine is linked to an automatic transmission, but GM is working on a manual transmission kit it hopes to have in the aftermarket soon. It also has supercharged 6.2-liter LSA and normally aspirated 7.0-liter LS7 E-Rod crate motors in development. The '55 E-Rod package includes Dynomax mufflers, Be Cool radiator and fan, Eaton limited slip differential, an aluminum driveshaft, Eaton coil springs, Monroe shocks, two-inch drop spindles, C4 Chevrolet Corvette brakes, Saginaw power steering gear, and wheels from the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro. Dave Ross from the GM Design studio did the styling work that includes PPG Waterborne paint, a Grant reproduction Corvette wood steering wheel mounted on an Ididit eight-position tilt steering column, Be Cool interior ventilation, and custom upholstery and other components from CARS Inc. of Rochester Hills.

2019-09-13 02:16:37,533 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - WYOMING -- A police expert in traffic crash reconstruction said there is blame to be shared between a speeding motorcyclist and the driver of the car that allegedly turned in front of the accident victim in July. But 48-year-old Wayne Lamont Jones could face at least four years in prison if he is convicted of operating without a valid driver's license and negligent homicide. Police say Jones made a left turn in his Chevy Impala on South Division Avenue near 32nd Street, allegedly in the path of the Kawasaki Ninja driven by Douglas Vander Hart. Wyoming police officer and accident reconstruction expert David Thompson said, based on his investigation, Vander Hart was going 11- to 15-mph faster than the posted 30 mph speed limit before the crash. Thompson testified Wednesday during a probable-cause hearing in Wyoming District Court, which resulted in the case being sent to Kent County Circuit Court for trial on the felony charges. Thompson said the motorcycle struck the passenger side of the Impala. When an officer arrived on the scene, he was able to talk to the injured Vander Hart as he sat about 20 feet from his mangled bike. The 29-year-old died not long after the crash. "(Vander Hart) was on both brakes as hard as he could," Thompson said, describing his attempt to halt the bike as a panic stop. "The crash probably would not have occurred if the motorcyclist had been traveling the speed limit." "There's probably a little bit of blame on both sides," Thompson said. Thompson said Jones was cooperative and remorseful and was trying to help Vander Hart on the scene. However, Judge Pablo Cortes said the fact that Jones did not have a valid Michigan license means he should not have been on the road in the first place and, in the eyes of the law, could be considered the cause of the crash. Jones has an old but lengthy nonviolent criminal record in New Jersey, and he remains in the Kent County Jail on a $50,000 bond. Vander Hart's family described the 29-year-old as a "big-hearted" man, church youth leader and a willing handyman. His parents, Al and Ginny, say they have forgiven the man involved in what they believe was a tragic accident.

2019-09-13 02:16:39,539 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- West Michigan retailers including MC Sports, Spartan Stores Inc. and Family Christian Stores will receive checks this week totaling more than $2.1 million. The holiday bonuses are part of a $1.1 billion final payout to about 634,000 merchants nationwide resulting from a landmark antitrust settlement with credit card giants Visa and MasterCard. "The timing of these checks couldn't be better," said Tracy Mullin, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation. "They come during a difficult holiday season and will help retailers position themselves to participate in the economic recovery that lies ahead." The federation and other trade groups were class representatives in the lawsuit. "This is likely the largest single payment to businesses in a class action in history," said Jeffrey Shinder of the New York law firm Constantine Cannon, which represented the retail industry in the legal fight. The checks will range from thousands of dollars to more than $50 million, depending on how much retailers paid in challenged fees. Those receiving the checks include Walmart Stores Inc., Lowe's Cos. and many smaller retailers. Not on the list is Meijer Inc. The Walker-based retail chain sued the credit card issuers separately and settled its case years ago, said company spokeswoman Stacie Behler. "I can tell you the terms were quite favorable to us," said Behler, who didn't disclose how much the retailer received in the settlement. The payout represents the final disbursement of the $3.4 billion settlement negotiated in 2003 by Constantine Cannon, formerly Constantine & Partners. More than 90 percent of the merchants receiving checks are retailers. Other members of the class include educational institutions, charities and state government entities. While Spartan Stores, the owner of Family Fare and D & W Fresh Market, declined to discuss how much it expects to receive, the "amount represents a small percentage of the fees we pay each year to accept Visa and MasterCard transactions," said spokeswoman Jeanne Norcross. The largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history, the agreement also allowed merchants to reject Visa and MasterCard debit cards that carry high transaction fees.

2019-09-13 02:16:41,543 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Robert Snell The Detroit News The management shakeup at General Motors Co. continued late Wednesday with the surprise retirement of Chevrolet Vice President Brent Dewar, who had been appointed to lead the automaker's largest and most important brand five months ago. He is being replaced by James Campbell, 45, who ran GM's fleet and commercial operations, and will serve as Chevrolet general manager. Dewar, 54, was appointed to the job by ousted CEO Fritz Henderson in July after serving as GM Europe's vice president, sales, marketing and aftersales. Dewar spent 31 years at GM and was perceived to be closely aligned with Henderson, who resigned under pressure from the board of directors last week. "He was a Fritz guy and that can put you in some element of concern," said Rebecca Lindland, IHS Global Insight director of automotive research. "The GM-lifer stamp is not a stamp of approval. These are people whose careers are measured in decades and now the results are measured in months." Bloomberg News reported late Wednesday that Buick GMC General Manager Michael Richards was leaving the company after eight days on the job; GM would not confirm the report. Dewar's last day is April 1. GM said he is retiring to spend more time with his family and pursue personal interests. The Chevrolet position is a key job because GM anticipates the brand accounting for about 70 percent of its sales. Chevy's sales for November were 99,663, an increase of 4.8 percent from a year ago, accounting for 13.3 percent of the market. Chevrolet has arguably two of GM's most important launches next year with the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric car and the Cruze compact. The Volt is expected to help change perceptions about GM while the Cruze is expected to be a high-volume, fuel-efficient vehicle that gets up to 40 miles per gallon on the highway. "Jim has a strong track record of building relationships and partnerships with dealers and customers, and deep Chevrolet experience," said Susan Docherty, GM vice president of sales, service and marketing. "His energy, drive for results and willingness to take risks are great assets for leading the growing global Chevrolet brand." Campbell joined GM in 1988 and has been involved with launches of the Chevrolet Impala, Monte Carlo, Colorado and Corvette. He also has worked in field sales, retail incentives, marketing and customer-relationship management. The move comes five days after Chairman and interim CEO Ed Whitacre reshuffled senior management. rsnell@detnews.com (313) 222-2028

2019-09-13 02:16:43,543 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Mark Hornbeck Detroit News Lansing Bureau Lansing — Five small manufacturing companies won $15.5 million in federal stimulus awards to help them move into making green energy systems and parts, Gov. Jennifer Granholm announced today. The firms will diversify from making tanks, auto parts and boats to manufacturing solar shingles, wind turbines and windmills. The governor's office reported the grants will create or retain 713 jobs. The state has invested $1 billion in renewable and alternative energy, Granholm said. Firms awarded grants include: •Astraeus Wind Energy Inc. of Eaton Rapids, $7 million to make wind turbine blades and hubs •Energetx Companies LLC of Holland, $3.5 million to manufacture large composite wind turbines •Loc Performance Products Inc. of Plymouth, $1.5 million to make gears and gearboxes for utility windmills •LUMA Resources LLC of Rochester Hills, $500,000 to manufacture shingles for the residential solar market •Merrill Technologies Group of Saginaw, $3 million to make large-scale wind turbine blades and other components On other topics at a Lansing news conference: •"I'll take what we can get," the governor said when asked whether she supports a Senate bill that would raise the diesel tax by 4 cents a gallon to generate $36 million for bridge repairs. "If there's some momentum for that, we should do it." •On the prospect of getting no revenue increases from the Legislature to pay for Promise grants or soften cuts in school aid and revenue sharing by the end of this year, she said: "Everything is blocked in the Senate. If the Senate moves some things it can be done." •A second, jobs-focused stimulus package may save police, firefighter and teaching jobs in the state in the budget year that begins Oct. 1, 2010, Granholm said. She said the 20 percent cuts she's asked departments to make in anticipation of next year's revenue decline "is a worst-case scenario."

2019-09-13 02:16:45,551 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Christine Ferretti The Detroit News Mount Clemens – A Harrison Township woman who spent more than four years behind bars on a child abuse conviction was granted bond Wednesday as she awaits a new trial. Julie Baumer's relatives and supporters hugged and shook hands after Macomb County Circuit Court Judge James M. Biernat outlined the terms of her release from the Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Ypsilanti. "I feel justice has been done. She's innocent," said Julie's mother, Victoria Rose-Baumer. "We never expected the first conviction. It was unjust." Biernat granted Baumer, 33, a new trial in November on claims her previous legal representation was inadequate. She was convicted in 2005 of first-degree child abuse for shaking her infant nephew, Philipp Baumer, and leaving him blind and brain-injured. The boy has since been adopted and renamed Ben Zentz. Biernat set a cash or surety bond of $25,000. Baumer will be required to wear a GPS tether and reside at the Grace Centers of Hope in Pontiac, a faith-based rehabilitation campus. She's also expected to begin working for her former Mount Clemens employer, Alliance Financial, next week. Biernat prohibited Baumer from having contact with Ben or his new family, as well as young children. Ben's adoptive parents, Debi and Philip Zentz, who attended the hearing Wednesday, said the bond was reasonable. "It'll be good for her to go reside at this facility and benefit from the programs they can offer her," said Debi Zentz, who has said the thought of a new trial is troubling. She just wants justice for Ben and for Baumer to serve the time she was given. The judge's decision to grant a new trial followed a series of evidentiary hearings this fall in which Baumer's new attorneys — Carl Marlinga and Charles Lugosi — presented experts who testified that the boy's injuries were consistent with venous sinus thrombosis or a "childhood stroke," rather than shaking. Biernat said Baumer's previous attorney deprived her of a substantial defense by failing to retain an expert who could back up the theory that a stroke may have caused Ben's condition. The Macomb County Prosecutor's Office plans to challenge the judge's ruling with the state Court of Appeals. Once they do, Baumer and her attorneys will have to wait to see if the higher court will affirm Biernat's decision. The University of Michigan Innocence Clinic has agreed to represent Baumer on appeal. Baumer is serving a 10- to 15-year sentence.

2019-09-13 02:16:47,553 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By David Shepardson Detroit News Washington Bureau Washington — The Obama administration's decision to extend the life of the $700 billion Wall Street and auto bailout fund until October means auto finance company GMAC has more time to negotiate for additional aid. Detroit-based GMAC Inc. has received $13.5 billion in government support and has been in talks with the White House about an additional infusion of up to $5.6 billion. Extending the life of the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program past its scheduled Dec. 31 expiration, to Oct. 3, 2010, means GMAC may get more money, even if it can't wrap up a deal with the government by the end of the year. The money would be used to help make additional vehicle loans, which General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC say is crucial in their comeback effort. Both automakers offer consumer financing through GMAC, and their dealers borrow money from GMAC to buy vehicles for their showrooms. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced the extension of the TARP fund in a letter Wednesday. Geithner said the government plans to use no more than $550 billion of the $700 billion appropriated for the TARP fund. "As a result," he said, "we expect that TARP will cost taxpayers at least $200 billion less than was projected in August." The fund has provided about $82 billion in loans to automakers and auto finance companies. Late Wednesday, the Government Accountability Office issued a report confirming the government's latest estimate that it lost $30.48 billion of its investment in the auto industry. But that is down from an unpublished earlier projection of $43.7 billion. The GAO said the government has also lost about $30 billion on its investment in insurance giant American International Group Inc. President Barack Obama said this week that Congress should use unused TARP funds for job creation and deficit reduction. Obama on Wednesday lamented the need for the bank and auto bailouts. "Because of distasteful but necessary steps to help our auto industry recover and stabilize our banks, we've pulled our economy back from the abyss," he said. Geithner said the government now expects "a positive return from the government's investments" in Wall Street banks. "We also expect to recover all but $42 billion of the $364 billion in TARP funds disbursed" this year, he said. A large chunk of those losses are related to automakers. On Tuesday, Gene Sperling, a senior Treasury official, defended the auto program losses, noting they could shrink if the auto industry keeps improving. Obama acted "courageously" to save hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, even though it wasn't popular, Geithner said. The government won't use any more bailout funds "unless necessary to respond to an immediate and substantial threat to the economy stemming from financial instability. As a nation, we must maintain capacity to respond," Geithner said. Rep. Dave Camp of Midland, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, supported the government bailout of GM, but said the TARP fund has become a "revolving slush fund" and should be ended. Camp was among those calling on President Obama to use unused TARP funds to reduce the deficit. dshepardson@detnews.com (202) 662-8735

2019-09-13 02:16:49,554 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Charlie LeDuff The Detroit News Detroit — As the bell peeled 12 from the belfry of the Sacred Heart of Mary Catholic Church on Tuesday, little Martha Ann Barnett was finally laid to rest. She was the 15-year-old bystander gunned-down in a drive-by shooting on the city's west side nearly two years ago. Her cremated remains had been stored in her grandmother's linen closet because the old woman was too poor to bury her. In the meantime, Little Martha Ann was buried next to her grandfather, Clarence, due to the kindness of strangers. After reading about the situation in The Detroit News, condolence letters and checks both big and small came from across the country: from Santa Barbara, Calif.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Toledo, Ohio; Sterling Heights. And of course, Detroit. At least 70 people so far have sent cards and donated $2,500, said Duane Anders, director of the Sacred Heart Cemetery, who is handling the details. More is promised. Any extra money beyond the cost of the $650 burial will be sent to the Capuchin Soup Kitchen to feed the needy in the name of Little Martha. This is the finest Christmas present the grandmother has received, she reckoned, admiring the donated headstone that carries her husband's and granddaughter's names. It is a gift that reaffirms her belief that people at their root are good and life's meaning is to be found in one another. "It was my dream to have her buried with her granddaddy but I didn't think it was ever going to be possible," said the old woman, whose name is also Martha Barnett. "Tell everyone that put in a helping hand that I appreciate them and their kindness. It'll never be forgotten. May God bless every one of them." Anders dug a hole in the soft earth with a square shovel big enough to accommodate the small brass box. "I'm sorry to meet you like this," he said to Barnett. "We have too many young people here." Martha was murdered in a northwestern Detroit drive-by shooting in January 2008. The confession of a man who admitted a role in her killing was tossed out of court. The man, Deandre Woolfolk, now is jailed in connection with the beating death of a man in a Southfield nightclub. He is scheduled to appear today in 46th District Court. The old woman forgot to bring her Bible, too consumed in the joy and sorrow of it all. Her daughter — Martha's mother — did not attend, too busy with her demons. The service also was attended by the cemetery director and two reporters. The day was cold, the sun obscured in the clouds as though it were covered in muslin. Barnett croaked her way through the Lord's Prayer, her eyes red and moist, her shoes thin. "Praise the Lord," she said at the end of the little service. "They can't hurt her no more. I'm going to remember the good things, how she used to sing and dance." charlie@detnews.com (313) 222-2071

2019-09-13 02:16:51,557 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - CARSON CITY -- Covered in blood and shaking, a Carson City Correctional Facility prison guard who allegedly was stabbed in the head with a pitchfork by an inmate Tuesday told Beth Palmer to call for help because he thought he was involved in an accident. The disoriented man lapsed in and out of consciousness. He was incoherent and, at times, unresponsive. Slowly, Sam Olivo, a 55-year-old from St. Johns and a 22-year state prison system employee, revealed he was jumped by at least one and up to five inmates assigned to a nearby work detail. The suspects, captured about three hours later and about 50 miles south of the site of the 11:30 a.m. escape, had stolen the van the crew was using. "It was clear he was pretty badly beaten and in a state of shock," said Lee Palmer, whose wife cared for Olivo before authorities arrived. "Blood was everywhere and as what happened began to emerge, it was really unbelievable." Olivo stumbled up to a half-mile from the site where the inmates were clearing brush and cutting trees along a drainage ditch before finding help. Olivo was unconscious and in serious condition at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, said Mel Grieshaber, executive director of the Michigan Corrections Organization The guard is expected to survive. Department of Corrections policy allows guards to be alone when supervising field work, a procedure Grieshaber said is flawed. Olivo was unarmed. "We don't think there's many good guys in prison," Grieshaber said. "Everyone is a danger, and (guards) are out there alone and unarmed with so-called well-behaved prisoners." Inmates approved for outside work are minimum security prisoners who are often non-violent offenders and close to release, said John Cordell, a prison spokesman. "There is a low propensity for assault, a very low escape risk," Cordell said. "We don't see it very often that they jeopardize themselves by getting involved in something like this." Authorities said the alleged attack on Olivo began outside the work van, where one inmate began beating the guard. It wasn't immediately clear if the attack was planned or an impetuous act. The four other inmates claim they were in the vehicle and not part of the incident, Cordell said. Officials identified the suspects as: -- Daniel Henry, a 36-year-old convicted of home invasion. -- Dennis Hall, 45, imprisoned for receiving and concealing a stolen car. -- Andrew Lang, 50, who was serving time for a felony child support offense. -- Ranar Cook, 28, who had four months left behind bars on a felony firearm conviction. -- Lucas Schuster, 28, of Allegan, who has methamphetamine-related convictions.

2019-09-13 02:16:53,563 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- The Grand Valley Metro Council, created two decades ago to bring communities together and guide area growth, lacks impact and has not realized its promise, Kent County's top administrator says. For that reason -- and the county's serious financial hole -- Kent officials are planning to cut their dues in half after considering pulling out altogether. Commissioners are expected to approve a budget Thursday that reduces the county's annual allocation to the agency from $71,000 to $35,000. The cut is small compared to the $9.7 million deficit commissioners are trying to offset next year. But the symbolism is large. Kent is the largest dues payer among all communities, and some city officials are wondering about the future of the regional planning body. "What was touted 20 years ago hasn't materialized," said County Administrator Daryl Delabbio, who recommended leaving Metro Council. "Because the enabling legislation (creating such agencies) has no teeth, we don't have much impact on actual planning and zoning. We only serve to facilitate." Delabbio said his recommendation was based mostly on financial realities as the county considers cutting 145 jobs. "You have to look at this versus an employee or other services. We're trying to reach a balance that makes sense." The county's Finance Committee restored $35,000 in dues and asked commission Chairman Roger Morgan to explore whether the county can stay involved for a lesser amount. "The consensus among the committee is that we're not getting $71,000 worth of value out of the Metro Council, but there's also a reticence to completely withdraw," said committee Chairman Dean Agee, R-Grand Rapids Township. Don Stypula, Metro Council executive director, said Kent's proposed cut would hurt, but he's more concerned if others follow suit. Metro Council consists of 46 member communities and agencies such as the Kent County Road Commission and Gerald R. Ford International Airport. It has been involved with projects such as the I-196 Baldwin Street interchange in Georgetown Township and the new interchange at 44th Street over U.S. 131. "Kent County is the biggest player in the Metro Council family, but the one thing we're not going to do is panic," Stypula said. "I've already begun sitting down with my senior staff and considering what the impacts would be." Metro Council has a 2009 general fund budget of about $2 million. Dues provide $354,000 that is used as local matches to bring in about $10 million yearly in federal transportation grants, Stypula said.

2019-09-13 02:16:55,562 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Mark Hornbeck Detroit News Lansing Bureau Lansing — Instant message to Michigan motorists: Texting while driving may soon be illegal. The House voted 94-13 on Tuesday to make sending or receiving text messages or e-mails while driving a secondary offense, meaning motorists could be ticketed if pulled over by police for speeding or some other offense. Meanwhile, the Senate Transportation Committee approved similar legislation Tuesday, as well as a 4-cents-per-gallon increase on diesel fuel to generate $36 million to fix bridges across the state. "We've all seen other drivers who are concentrating more on their cell phones than on driving, and because of this they are putting themselves and all of our lives at risk," said House Speaker Andy Dillon, D-Redford Township. House officials cited a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that said about 80 percent of accidents and 65 percent of near-accidents involve a driver looking away from the roadway within three seconds of the situation. They also noted 19 states ban texting while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. Hours before the House vote, the Senate committee voted unanimously in favor of a two-bill package that also makes texting while behind the wheel a secondary offense. Sen. Judson Gilbert, R-Algonac, the committee chairman, said it's "simply a safety issue. "Having tried it once, I don't know how anybody can text while driving. But people are doing it." The committee also passed the bill on raising the state tax on diesel fuel from 15 cents to 19 cents a gallon, which is the levy on gasoline. The Legislature has tried and failed several times over the years to approve the 4-cent increase. Gilbert wasn't certain when the bills will be taken up by the full Senate, which adjourns for the holidays Dec. 17. mhornbeck@detnews.com (313) 222-2470

2019-09-13 02:16:57,569 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Kim Kozlowski The Detroit News The University of Michigan will now be accepting donated human embryos to create embryonic stem cell lines, launching research aimed at improved treatments for diseases, researchers said Tuesday. The announcement means that U-M can begin long-awaited research on incurable illnesses like Lou Gehrig's disease. State restrictions on such research were lifted last year when voters approved a constitutional amendment. It already has put Michigan in the stem cell spotlight, academically and economically, as U-M joins a small class of other universities nationwide that are creating stem cell lines to do ground-breaking science. But it comes as some lawmakers are trying to pass bills to add parameters that some say would stymie the progress the state has made. "This is the beginning of a new era," said Eva Feldman, a U-M researcher and neurologist. For years, proponents of stem cell research tried to change Michigan's law, among the most restrictive in the nation. But the effort dragged on since it was rebuffed by those who view embryonic stem cell research as immoral for the destruction of embryos created through in-vitro fertilization that are no longer needed. After voters approved the constitutional amendment in November 2008, residents began asking U-M how they could donate their frozen embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization. But the university needed to develop a consent process and get it approved by university committees before the work could begin. "We wanted to do it right," said Gary Smith, co-director of the U-M Consortium for Stem Therapies, which joins a handful of universities nationwide creating stem cell lines. 'Unprecedented potential' Since the vote, $6.8 million in federal stimulus dollars have been awarded to Michigan stem cell researchers. Detroit was selected as the site for the 2010 World Stem Cell Summit, a global gathering of researchers, entrepreneurs and policymakers. The Food and Drug Administration also approved the first clinical trial of stem cells involving humans with Lou Gehrig's disease to be overseen by Feldman. "I am convinced (stem cell research) is one of the best opportunities to attract investment, create jobs and emerge from this recession with a revitalized economy," said A. Alfred Taubman, who invested millions into passing the constitutional amendment and the U-M Consortium for Stem Cell Therapies after watching a friend die from Lou Gehrig's disease. "It also has unprecedented potential to cure diseases that affect millions of people around the world. But there are people who want to undo the progress we've made." Today, a Senate subcommittee is poised to vote on a package of bills that proponents say would add definition to the constitutional amendment. Opponents say it would gut the will of the people. That's not true, said Sen. Tom George, R-Kalamazoo, and head of the Senate Health Policy Committee. George says the package makes the amendment clearer and includes penalties and fines for violating the law. He added the laws are necessary for the private sector conducting stem cell research since it is not bound by federal guidelines. "Vagaries in the law are no good for anyone," said George. Feldman, the keynote speaker Tuesday at a Detroit Economic Club luncheon at the Westin Book Cadillac in Detroit, said the bills would limit researchers to only being able to create and freeze stem cell lines. If the bills were passed, researchers could not work on incurable diseases or other research that could lead to better therapies for people suffering from diseases such as juvenile diabetes, dementia and Parkinson's. It took months for U-M to be ready to create its first embryonic stem cell lines, which are constantly dividing cells originating from a stem cell, because the work needed to be approved by two university committees. Life sciences sector growing The state is taking steps to diversify the economy, Feldman said. She also noted that the life sciences sector in Michigan over a seven-year period grew 10.7 percent while manufacturing declined 24.7 percent. "There's excitement, there's investment in stem cell research," said Feldman. Kathleen Russell, who has suffered from Parkinson's nearly 12 years, said 40,000 people also suffer from the debilitating movement disorder. But her faith taught her that a mustard seed can move a mountain, she said. "For us, embryonic stem cells are indeed smaller than a mustard seed," said Russell, an Ann Arbor resident who attended the luncheon to support continued stem cell research in Michigan. "But it has the scientific power to move mountains." To donate For information on donating human embryos to U-M, visit http://stemcellresearch.umich.edu.proxy1.cl.msu.edu

2019-09-13 02:16:59,573 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Bryce G. Hoffman The Detroit News Ford Motor Co. will invest up to $500 million and create more than a thousand new jobs in Michigan to support its electric vehicle programs if state lawmakers expand an existing incentive program and approve $85 million in tax credits, the company said Tuesday. If those conditions are met, the Dearborn automaker would engineer and assemble battery packs for a new generation of hybrid vehicles in Michigan. Ford also would commit to manufacturing a new hybrid and plug-in hybrid here that would be based on the same platform as the new Ford Focus it plans to unveil in Detroit in January. These moves would consolidate much of Ford's electric vehicle research, development, engineering and manufacturing in the state. Nancy Gioia, director of Ford's global electrification programs, said Michigan's commitment to battery technology and manufacturing makes it a great fit for Ford's plan, which she said would benefit the state. "It promotes Michigan's competitiveness," she said. "It strengthens Michigan's advanced technology manufacturing base. It really is an engine for economic growth." A spokeswoman for Gov. Jennifer Granholm said the governor supports Ford's request. Last year, the state authorized tax credits for high-capacity lithium-ion battery pack assembly. Now, Ford is asking the state to expand those incentives to include lower-capacity batteries used in hybrid vehicles. Specifically, Ford is asking for $85 million in tax credits from that program through 2014, and an additional $35 million beyond 2014 if the lithium-ion cells used in the battery packs are manufactured in Michigan. The battery packs Ford uses in its hybrid cars and trucks are designed and produced by Delphi Corp. in Mexico. But Gioia said engineering and assembling these packs is a "critical core competency" that Ford needs to move in-house. "It's a critical core competency to delivering the vehicle function, its DNA, its durability, its reliability and for getting every joule of energy out of the vehicle," she said, adding that automakers are struggling to keep up with the rapid advances in lithium-ion cell technology. "By controlling the battery system development, we're making ourselves able to respond very quickly." Derrick Kuzak, Ford's head of global product development, said this is key to Ford's competitiveness in the emerging electric vehicle market. For example, he said Ford has been able to modify the battery control system on its new 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid to deliver best-in-class fuel economy and a higher electric-only speed. "That ability comes not so much from cell technology itself, but the way that we're controlling the battery system," Kuzak said. Ford, which was the first U.S. carmaker to bring a hybrid to market, offers four hybrids in the United States. In January, it announced plans to introduce a battery powered version of its Transit Connect commercial van to fleet customers next year, to be followed by a battery powered version of the new Focus compact in 2011. The company also promised to introduce a next-generation hybrid and plug-in hybrid in 2012. On Tuesday, Ford said both of those vehicles will be built off the same platform as the new Focus, which will be produced at the company's Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne. The hybrid and plug-in hybrid would likely be produced on the same assembly line. Ford said it has not decided where in Michigan the batteries would be assembled. Gioia said the packs could be assembled at an existing facility or at a new factory. Gioia said Delphi may continue to supply some of the components used to produce its battery packs. Ford's announcement came a day after General Motors Co. said it would invest $336 million to upgrade its Detroit-Hamtramck plant to produce the extended range electric Chevrolet Volt and the next-generation Malibu. GM announced earlier this year that it would assemble its own battery packs in Brownstown Township. University of Michigan economist George Fulton said these investments are "positive signs" that the state's efforts to become a hub for green vehicle development and manufacturing are "gaining traction." "It's like a snowball rolling down the mountain," he said. "It's too early to say if it will really take hold, but this is encouraging." Megan Brown, a Granholm spokeswoman, said Ford's plan would aid the state's efforts to develop a nascent battery industry. "It's consistent with everything we've been trying to do over the past three years to attract this new industry sector," she said. "Coming after the Chevy Volt announcement Monday, it's great news." Gioia outlined Ford's plan for Michigan senators Tuesday and is scheduled to meet with state representatives today. She said Ford has other sites in mind if Michigan lawmakers are unwilling to support the project with tax credits. Some still oppose such incentives. "The fact that we have to give tax credits tells us that our taxes on economic activity are too high," said Gary Wolfram, a professor of political economy at Hillsdale College. "What we're doing is making it more difficult for us to lower the tax burden as a whole, which is really what we ought to be doing." Ford's battery plan •What Ford wants: Lawmakers to expand an existing law offering tax incentives for assembling battery packs used in electric vehicles to include packs used in hybrids •How much Ford wants: $85 million in tax credits through 2014; $35 million beyond that if it can find a source for battery cells in Michigan •What Ford will do: In-source engineering and production of battery packs for its next-generation hybrid vehicles; produce a new hybrid and plug-in hybrid in Michigan, starting in 2012 Ford Motor Co. bhoffman@detnews.com (313) 222-2443

2019-09-13 02:17:01,572 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - KENTWOOD -- Police and fire levies, income taxes, shortening City Hall's work week and making more employee cuts were among ideas shared with city officials at a forum Monday night. After cutting 21 positions in October and reducing this year's $27 million operating budget $1.26 million, the city still faces a deficit of about $2 million in its estimated $25.8 million 2010-11 budget. Kentwood city officials asked for public input as they struggle to find ways to continue providing services at the same levels. "I'm here to advocate for a millage," said Gladys Verhulst, a city resident. "If we want services, we've got to pay for them." Mayor Richard Root has asked the City Commission to consider a levy by Jan. 5 to be on the May ballot. Budgeted positions for the Kentwood Police Department have fallen from 71 officers in 2006 to 61 officers for 2010. Similarly, firefighters have dropped from 43 to 37 for the same period. Overall, the city has decreased city employees from 239 workers in 2006 to 194 in 2010. Roger Brouwer, a city resident, said police and fire personnel levels should be maintained. He also suggested City Hall consider operating on a four-day week, not five. "I wouldn't have a problem with a millage for police and fire," said Albert Kuperus, a 36-year city resident. "We need them. They're pretty crucial." But John Pellerito said he's definitely against any levy increase. "If you don't have the money in your household budget, you don't spend it," he said. "And neither should the city. "They should live with the money they get." Mike Miles said he would consider a city income tax and long-range solutions. "We need to find things that will provide stability to our revenues," he said. "That's the trick." City Commissioner Sharon Brinks said she has concerns about a potential levy for public safety. "We don't deal with it by putting our finger in the dike when we need to have a complete dike-rebuilding process," she said. After listening, asking questions and explaining the city's situation, Root said: "We have to do something. And I think after tonight, I'm feeling a little better about asking citizens if they want a millage."

2019-09-13 02:17:03,579 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By David Shepardson Detroit News Washington Bureau Washington — The battle over the closing of more than 2,000 General Motors and Chrysler dealers isn't over yet. Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, is working on an amendment to a financial services bill that would provide more favorable arbitration rights to dealers but take away compensation they had sought to help them wind down their operations. Last week, General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC announced an offer to end months of wrangling in Congress by agreeing to arbitration on limited issues. Dealers want independent arbitration panels to be able to consider more than what automakers propose. In June, Chrysler closed 789 of its dealers during its bankruptcy stay, while GM plans to trim at least 1,350 dealers by October 2010. Nearly two-thirds of House members and 46 senators back a bill that would attempt to legally bar GM from closing dealers and seek to reopen the Chrysler dealerships. Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said Monday in Washington that the company had offered as much as it could do. "It's a fair solution for what has been an unnecessarily thorny issue," Marchionne said at an appearance here, declining to comment on the new legislative proposal. The National Automobile Dealers Association supports the legislative efforts. "NADA supports this approach unless GM and Chrysler agree to an alternative that addresses dealer concerns," it said in a statement. "The revised amendment would give affected dealers transparency and the right to arbitrate. The arbitrator would balance the interests of the dealer, the manufacturer and the general public. Regrettably, the revised amendment would not provide compensation for affected dealers." GM and Chrysler officials, however, say if Congress passes legislation, their proposals are off the table. Congressional leaders said last week the automaker proposals don't go far enough. "It is positive that GM and Chrysler are offering a chance for rejected dealers to meet and appeal their company's decision," said Katie Grant, a spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. But "arbitration must allow for consideration of all information that dealers and the company want to present and not be limited to a narrow set of criteria that predetermines the outcome." Last week's move is a reversal for Chrysler, which for months insisted it would not hear appeals and would not provide dealers any money for shutting down. By contrast, GM heard hundreds of appeals, reversed itself in about 70 cases and provided $600 million to help dealers wind down their operations. dshepardson@detnews.com (202) 662-8735

2019-09-13 02:17:05,579 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Jim Lynch The Detroit News St. Clair Shores — Residents along contaminated canals near 10 Mile had hoped for years that there was an end in sight to their environmental nightmare. But new test results of the waters there show the problems might be worsening. Federal, state and local officials have spent more than seven years and $10 million trying to rid the canals and groundwater of hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. These man-made chemicals have been found to cause a range of illnesses, from acne and rashes to liver cancer. The federal government banned their use in the 1970s. St. Clair Shores residents are all too familiar with PCBs after watching their continued presence help to drive down housing values. New testing found concentrations of PCBs higher than ever before and in places where the chemicals previously hadn't been a problem. Samples of underground oil taken from two sites near the Bon Brae/Harper intersection showed PCB readings of 98,000 parts per million and 820,000 parts per million. One part per million is considered safe for human health by state standards. "The numbers surprised our consultants. They surprised officials at the city of St. Clair Shores and they surprised us," said William Misterovich, deputy Macomb County public works commissioner. "The numbers are just astronomical. I believe they are the highest we've ever tested out there." Samples also show elevated levels of PCBs in the two canals serving Bayview Drive and Lakecrest and Rio Vista streets — canals that have not had major problems before now. St. Clair Shores officials have scheduled a public information meeting on the latest data for 7 p.m. Thursday in the City Council chambers at 27600 Jefferson Circle Drive. Roughly a half-mile south, the canals behind Lange and Revere streets have been plagued by PCBs since 2001. Since that time, millions of dollars in remediation efforts have brought about occasional proclamations of success — only to be proven wrong when new test results show the PCBs remain. State officials asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to place the 10 Mile Drain Area on the Superfund National Priorities list — a move that could make the project eligible for more federal funding and could lead to the eventual identification of the contamination source. The failure to identify and address the source after nearly eight years has been particularly frustrating to residents like Bruce Terwilliger. "Now, we're right back to square one, because we never removed the source," said the 76-year-old Lange Street resident. "It's still there." jlynch@detnews.com (313) 222-2034

2019-09-13 02:17:07,580 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - The Michigan Department of Transportation is looking at delaying 243 proposed road and bridge projects -- including 26 in Kent and Ottawa counties -- over the next five years unless the state comes up with the cash to match available federal funds. The proposal is part of MDOT's draft five-year plan for 2010-14. While $1.44 billion is designated for highway construction and maintenance in the current budget. that is expected to drop to $593 million in 2010-11 if the state cannot come up with another $84 million, according to MDOT. The state could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds. The projects were taken off because budget projections for state gas-tax revenues are not high enough to match federal money. "Michigan's transportation funding system is in a state of crisis," said Mike Nystrom, Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association spokesman, in a statement Monday. "Clearly, legislators can no longer ignore Michigan's crumbling infrastructure and allow the state to forego nearly 300 construction projects that will provide safer roadways and thousands of jobs to Michigan residents." The fixed per-gallon gasoline tax used to match federal funding and pay for road work stays the same, even when fuel prices rise or road-building materials increase in cost. There are proposals in the state House to gradually increase fuel taxes and registration fees the next five years for another $1.8 billion. Under a proposal, the gas tax would rise from 19 cents to a maximum of 34 cents per gallon the next seven years. Proponents of that increase are hopeful the expected loss of $600 million in federal highway funds will prompt lawmakers to finally act. The delayed projects locally include rebuilding M-11 (28th Street SE) between M-37 and I-96 in Kent County and widening M-104 (Cleveland Road) from 124th Avenue to I-96 in Ottawa County.

2019-09-13 02:17:09,588 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - GRAND RAPIDS -- Rushing to her son's side as he stood across the street from his burning home, a frantic Frances Estrada wanted to know where her grandchildren were and if they were hurt. "Where are my babies?" Estrada screamed to her 26-year-old son, Jonathan Brito. "Oh, my God, how are my babies?" Brito, his face black with soot from carrying his two sons out a burning doorway, embraced and reassured her that Kaidon, 2, and Jaidon, 4, were fine and in a warm apartment nearby. Brito said he awoke to his wife yelling that their house, at 253 Barnett St. NE, was on fire. "I just ran for the kids; that's all I was thinking," Brito said minutes after he was credited with saving the children from the 11:45 a.m. fire. "I grabbed them and ran downstairs and out of the house. That door, it was on fire, but it was the fastest way out." The boys' father said the house was filled with fire and smoke. Neither he nor his wife, Charlene Hernandez, 26, could see through the thick haze. "I just knew where to go," he said. The four family members were evaluated for smoke inhalation, but all were unhurt, fire officials said. A fire investigator was working to determine the cause of the blaze that left the house extensively damaged, Battalion Chief Jerry Salatka said. Brito said he and his wife believe the fire started from an electrical outlet where their Christmas tree was plugged in, inside the main floor living area. The tree, with presents underneath, was turned off because they saw a spark from the outlet Sunday. Hernandez had just returned from her third-shift factory job and was asleep on a couch only feet from where the fire is believed to have started, said Brito, who works at a downtown restaurant. "We lost everything, but I got all I need out of there," Brito said. "Thank God we're OK."

2019-09-13 02:17:11,589 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - By Alisa Priddle The Detroit News One future product idea that has survived the transition from bankrupt Chrysler to the new Chrysler Group LLC is a unibody pickup to replace the Dodge Dakota, which will be discontinued in 2011. "As we look to replace the Dakota with a different product, there are some opportunities with (partner) Fiat (SpA) that we have and we need to examine," Fred Diaz, head of the Ram brand, said in an interview with The Detroit News. But there also are possibilities "within the walls of Chrysler that we're looking at as well that could end up being a very good replacement for the Dakota," Diaz said. A car-based pickup was already in the works before Chrysler's financial difficulties forced it into bankruptcy and a partnership with Fiat. The company was developing a multipurpose vehicle from a more fuel-efficient car platform. What was envisioned was a front-wheel-drive truck with all-wheel-drive capability and a direct-injection and turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Diaz is on the same page. "The emphasis is going to be on getting a vehicle that is still true to the Ram brand image and also gets excellent miles per gallon rating and at an attractive price point," he said. One of the problems with the Dakota was that it was too close in price to a full-size Ram. With its replacement, "we're trying to increase the size of that gap between midsize truck and full-size truck," Diaz said. But the popularity of compact pickups is declining. They account for 5 percent of U.S. sales; full-size pickups represent almost 23 percent. And the Dakota has not fared well. Dodge sold only 663 Dakotas in November, down 62 percent, and only 10,072 have been sold this year. "When a vehicle is not doing well, you have two choices: change it or abandon it," said Van Conway, analyst and president of Conway MacKenzie Inc. in Birmingham. Chrysler is not the first to try to change it. The idea of a car-based pickup dates to the 2004 North American International Auto Show, where Honda Motor Co. showed the Ridgeline concept. The Ridgeline went on sale in 2005 to limited success. Sales through November are less than 15,000, down 54 percent, according to Autodata Corp. Toyota Motor Corp. showed the A-BAT concept, a small hybrid unibody pickup, at the 2008 Detroit auto show but has no immediate plans to put it into production, said spokesman John McCandless. "A lot of people have tried the idea of creating an almost-truck," said Gary Dilts, senior vice president with J.D. Power & Associates and a former Chrysler executive. "I can't think of anyone who has been successful." But James Bell, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book, disagrees. "I think unibody is the way to go." Diaz agrees. He said the decision to proceed will take into account the experiences of the competition. But he sees untapped potential. "If I had a nickel for every dealer who told me this is the type of truck that they dream of and want and could sell in volume, I could have retired by now."

2019-09-13 02:17:13,595 - DEBUG - context_text.article_coding.open_calais_v2.open_calais_v2_article_coder - CANNON TOWNSHIP -- A winter storm bearing down on West Michigan this week is expected to pump up the unusual naturally created snow base that allowed slopes to open over the weekend. Barren hills that were visible only four days ago at Cannonsburg Ski Area and neighboring Pando Winter Sports Park are unlikely to reappear, with between 6 and 12 inches expected to hit the ground this week. The snow-covered runs are a beautiful sight to snowboarders Alex McNamara and Justin VanderVelde. The Rockford friends, who have been practicing jumping and twirling tricks at Cannonsburg for a decade, said a "long" summer and fall left them eager to bust out their boards. "You have to wait all summer for it to start snowing, so you might as well (hit the hill) as soon as the snow falls," the 22-year-old VanderVelde said Sunday. And it was a quick turn, courtesy of a foot of snow that fell last week and temperatures that finally dropped enough to use snow-making machines. It allowed downstate resorts to open a week ahead of northern competitors Boyne and Crystal mountains and Caberfae Peaks. "We went from green grass to a lot of snow," said Pete Goodell, a manager at Pando. "We still had to make a lot with the machines, but it was a great start. "It was good to get going, and I hope we see it again soon," Goodell said. Bob Dukesherer, a National Weather Service meteorologist, says it's a near certainty that will happen by Tuesday, when a storm will settle in and hang over the region through Saturday. "It looks like a significant system that will bring heavy snow and everything winter has to offer," Dukesherer said. The storm could drop up to 12 inches of snow, computer models show. Dukesherer predicts strong winds will create whiteout conditions and drifting. Large back-to-back systems to start the season are somewhat infrequent, but meteorologists say early December is prone to heavy snowfalls. "It was quite rare to last as long as we did without snow," Dukesherer said. The forecast should make for good business at Cannonsburg, which drew several hundred customers on its first day of business Sunday, manager Steve Brown said. Brown's resort will be open all week while Pando, which opened Saturday, will resume operations on the weekend. Skier Rick DeGraaf, who was headed for his second ride on the lift at Cannonsburg on Sunday, said the day's moderate temperatures made for a nice day on the hill. "It makes Michigan living a good thing," the 59-year-old from Rockford said.
